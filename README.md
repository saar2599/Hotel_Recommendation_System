# From Reviews to Reservations: A Data Science Approach to Hotel Recommendations

## Introduction and Statement of the Problem

Customer satisfaction is crucial in the hotel industry. Discovering customer preferences and making personalized recommendations can greatly improve the overall customer experience. Customer reviews and opinions about different hotels are now available thanks to online reviews like TripAdvisor. If used effectively, this information can provide valuable information to hotel management and potential customers.

With so many choices, customers often canâ€™t decide. One way to facilitate customer decision-making is to provide a system that effectively filters reviews and recommends the most suitable options. Hotels that can use recommendation engines gain a competitive advantage in the market. Hotels can do more business by offering personalized recommendations based on customer preferences.

The emergence of online review platforms has given customers a strong voice to share their experiences with other people. Customers can rate and review hotels, restaurants, and attractions in-depth on sites like TripAdvisor. Thanks to recent developments in text mining and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, valuable insights can now be extracted from textual data. Techniques such as topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and text summarization are crucial for understanding and analyzing customer reviews. Finding patterns and putting related data points in a group is possible by using machine learning algorithms like K-means clustering. Clustering algorithms can be used to find groups of hotels that share traits or customer opinions in the context of hotel reviews.

Across all online platforms, including streaming services and e-commerce websites, personalized recommendations are now commonplace. Businesses can increase customer satisfaction and engagement by customizing recommendations based on individual preferences.

## Abstract

Making decisions on which hotels to choose remains one of the major challenges for customers due to the widespread review systems with the vast amount of unstructured textual data. The diversity of opinions and experiences shared by users often makes the final decision on the hotel choice impossible and causes dissatisfaction with any chosen options. To mitigate the consequences of this issue, we introduce a recommender system based on machine learning. Our project strives to find the most important bottom-lines in TripAdvisor hotel reviews by scraping them and munging the gained textual data. The further implementation uses clustering algorithms to cluster reviews of one type, use sentence transformers, and further simplify customer choice of hotels. The implementation of the recommender system would take businesses to another level of customer centricity and strengthen their reputation.
