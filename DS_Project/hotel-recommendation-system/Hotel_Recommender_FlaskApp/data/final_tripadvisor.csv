0,fairmontdallas,"the with floor bathroom was damaged and the tub was cracked at dallas fairmont. there was no lotion in the bottle, which appears no housekeeping service. the entire room is deplorable. not luxury hotel"
1,fairmontdallas,"very disappointing experience starting with clearness to not working coffee machine no service no replenishment of bath/towels/coffee pads. 40 minutes wait for breakfast. dirty windows, carpets... smell at the room, service of the staff, housekeeper and front desk.."
2,fairmontdallas,"the fairmont dallas is a good hotel, but not a grand hotel. while i was there, i found the dinner menu to be average, presented on a simple document. there is a lot of construction going on. when i checked in at the front desk, no one mentioned the construction. it was noisy during the day."
3,fairmontdallas,spend the extra money to make sure you have a window that opens! i didn't love being in the recycle air with no windows to open. the staff here is amazing though. the parking lot across the street is 12$ a night vs the 50$ a night for valet and it was safe and easy!
4,fairmontdallas,sal was outdoing and friendly. which was refreshing on a cloudy day. i don’t drive downtown so was on edge. his friendly demeanour was relaxing. it is nice to see a smiling face these days as most people just do their job and go home with out interesting with others.
5,fairmontdallas,"every staff member gave exceptional service. however, the accommodations need major improving and upbraiding to match the staff members' level. the to remote didn't work upon arrival, and it took two replacement to get it right. the room temperature was very difficult to regulate. the room odor was very reminiscence of a hotel. the bed linens have seen better days. doesn't have the fairmont ""look"" and ""feel,"" and that's evident no matter how much you dim the lighting."
6,fairmontdallas,"the people are what have made this different from other conferences.  they are friendly and open.  staff has been fantastic also; knowledgeable, friendly, and professional.  information is relevant and timely."
7,fairmontdallas,overpriced food and drinks. hotel very outdated. not worth the money at all. room service prices are outrageous for what you get. way room many surchurges just to eat and or drink at the hotel. worse experience. and it was always freezing in the hotel. uncomfortable!
8,fairmontdallas,"although, i'm a hilton honors member .... i'm totally in love w/ this hotel! the bathroom are private, not made of glass, and provides total privacy.  this hotel is definitely a 5-star!! also, to my surprise, smoking is allowed on their terrace, there's also a beautiful pool w/ lots of lounging furniture, and the terrace wraps around the hotel to take in all of the views! i will definitely return ... thanks ""fairmount dallas"""
9,fairmontdallas,"worst fairmont experience i've ever had. room was not ready at 3 p.m. check-in time; had to sit in the lobby for almost 2 hours to wait. after i got to my room, the thermostat wouldn't work to regulate the temperature in my room; front desk/guess services promised 5 times to send engineering, and the best they could do was send a housekeeper to deliver a blanket! they also promised me a portable theater, which never did appear. the bathroom door was warped with peeling paint and wallpaper peeling off the wall above the toilet. front desk staff continued to assure me they would fix the heat, were fully booked, couldn't move me nor walk me to another hotel. no manager-on-duty to take my call or talk with me at check-out. this hotel does not deserve to be called part of the fairmont"
10,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"so our room had a water draining issue and grand took care of us. we went upstairs to great food with hare & our bartender alfred was the absolute best bartender ever, made this drink from his heart ❤️"
11,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,came to dallas with a muddy on a sports weekend. the hotel was included in our package. central to a point to the american airline center and at&t stadium.  however the rooms are extremely small. maids service was poor. beds sheets never got changed once in 4 days. they only made the beds 2 of 4 days. bathroom never got cleaned just towels replaced. garage never taken out. the lounge is ok when it’s not booked for private party’s. 3 out 4 nights it was closed.
12,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"at the exact time as check-in they had all the streets in and around the hotel shut down for 3-4 hours for a parade. although the hotel had no control over this i can not believe they did not send out an email to all the guests that would be at the hotel for that day to warn them. we were stuck in that traffic for hours and had to end up parking in a parking garage a block away and walking in.  thankful this ended up only costing $10 to leave overnight on a saturday night vs the hotels valet that $35!!! so, i highly recommend parking in that garage (by vs) and walking across the street for the $10 plus then you don’t have to wait the 30-45 minutes our friends did for their car.  the room is fine but i certainly would not classify this as a luxury or 4-5 star hotel.  the"
13,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"sophia was amazing! she knows how to take care of business in such a professional manner. i was blown away by the customer service and my overall experience there. well done, y'all have a tremendous employee."
14,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"great location across central expressly from sum. we usually stay here in dallas. it’s always friendly and easy. nice bar next to lobby. colonies at pm. breakfast to order now. eyelid and flex waited on us this morning. couldn’t have been better. used to have a breakfast buffets, which was a little handed. rooms are nice, comfortable and well appointed. just what i want."
15,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"my friend and i joined insight vacation for a month long holiday across the us from west to east.  all went well until we reached dallas downtown on 23 april 2019 and checked into our hotel room in magnolia hotels which was supposed to be a four star hotel.  however, we soon discovered that magnolia hotels does not deserve that rating as the condition of our room was no better than a 2 star hotel.  we are seasoned travelers and have been to many countries over the last 40 years and the hotel room that we were given was the worst in all our years of travelling.  the times in the bathroom were popping out and the water does not drain properly, resulting in us having to stand in a pool of water while having our shower.  while magnolia hotels did get someone to temporary fix the"
16,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"to;dr: didn’t blow me away but it’s pretty nice and perfect if you’re looking for a moderately prices hotel near the major tourist sites.   magnolia dallas is a classic yet modern hotel that’s generally located (equidistant (10-15 min walk) between the art museum and the penned stuff @ grassy knoll) and has nice clean rooms with mind bridges. it’s a bit business-y, but good for a short visit. it’s also one of the only hotels in the area that takes pets.   i stayed for 3 nights with a friend in a double queen room. the room was more spacious than a ny hotel but it had pretty drab wall color and door, which made it feel business-like. also, the desk chair was put off to the side because it didn’t fit into the desk without blocking one of the entrances to the bed. that was"
17,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,great service and super nice! we had a lot of fun and walter and juan are the best! fun bar and super accommodation. hotel is in a great location. walking distance to a lot of fun restaurant. we will be back!
18,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"murphy served drinks and entertained all night! up beat personality, funny, and very information about the area! would’ve left earlier if it weren’t for his conversation. will come see him again!!!!!"
19,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"stayed at magnolia for 2 night girls roadtrip and everything was excellent. we arrived earlier than expected and we were given a suite. kenneth, from the hotel restaurant offered us exceptional service."
20,omnidallashotel,great experience. spectacular service and wonderful amenities.i would recommend this location. not all locations are equal. charlotte location didn’t have the same results. you truly never have to leave the hotel. food is great service and amenities are everything promised in dallas.
21,omnidallashotel,"i can’t believe i am complaining after corona time.  not able to travel. yet,  i believe all heartily with keeping up with your mission statement . the hotel was not full . so why did we got connecting rooms with next door guests that celebrated loudly .   the omne hotels can’t short changed guests with silly items like ... body wash !  no body wash .  and by the maid words “you must ask at the reception we can’t give you body wash you ” it was stay i will not look forward repeating  ."
22,omnidallashotel,"definitely a five star hotel with convenient location. good restaurant inside. we have stayed here now three times for a total of 12 nights and all have been of top quality. mr o’day has been very friendly and provided us with good friendly service. all other staff also friendly and helpful. check in and out easy with no issues. room on 23 floor very clean, sanitized and comfortable.  beautiful view of the city. safe in room, night light on floor for easy night trip to bathroom. plenty of dangers in closet. bathroom had a nice easy walk-in shower. charge for wife, valet parking or self park both with a charge."
23,omnidallashotel,"my stay at the omne dallas was perfect! from booking the online reservation until the time we checked out. oscar was amazing, answering every question that i had and making sure my fiance and i had a great stay! you’re awesome oscar. upon check-in, back was welcoming and very knowledgeable. our room was on the word floor and the view was great.. the texas spice staff were super nice, the food was mummy, but those chocolate chip colonies were delicious!! we also saw staff members cleaning frequently touched places, like the elevators doors, buttons, and counters. the pool was so relaxing and the view was amazing. like i stated above, my stay was perfect and we’ll be back in about two weeks to experience this omne again."
24,omnidallashotel,"my wife and i stayed the weekend at the omne dallas. we usually stay at this location when visiting. per usual, it never disappoints and always thrill! the hotel staff from valet to the front desk personnel were welcoming and polite. there is countless things to do on property and many more within walking distance. visiting the pool is a must!! one restaurant on property is texas spice. i already left them a review this weekend. tripadvisor only allows one review in a 30 day period. so with that being said, we returned to texas spice and again were taken great care of! this time cord and page were right on point. very polite and took pride in their job. my wife and i will continue to stay at the dallas omne when we come in town. a+ to the omne and job well done!!!!"
25,omnidallashotel,"my husband and i celebrated our and wedding anniversary. the staff very thoughtful and customer service was awesome! the absence from the night skyline view to the sunrise in the morning were priceless.  wonderful dinner at bob speak house made us feel really special. recommend omne-downtown dallas off later ave.,quick get away, away from home especially if you are in the dew area."
26,omnidallashotel,we came here for our anniversary and everything was wonderful from the valet to the restaurant. we stayed for our anniversary and chose the romantic package. i recommend everyone try to stay at least once and you’ll see what i mean. this is my go to place now and i have been recommending it to everyone. thanks omne for a beautiful time.💕
27,omnidallashotel,"we went for new year's eve and the fireworks show at reunion tower. great experience, but room was pretty prices (polite way of saying excessive) compared to our previous stays here. bob's speak and chop house is an extraordinarily good place to eat. rooms are very nice, staff is excellent. we love it here and will return many times"
28,omnidallashotel,best place to observe fireworks from the reunion tower on new years eve. not from the guest room on the east side but the west side window at the elevator from any floor.  also thousands of people gather outside all around the omne to observe the fireworks.  glad i paid the premium price for this holiday outing.
29,omnidallashotel,"hands down dallas omne is the best hotel i have ever stayed in, in the nation and i've stayed at what i thought were the ""best"" before! everything was so perfect!  all the staff went above and beyond their job restrictions for sure. i truly appreciate it!"
30,hotelriuplaza,"just back from a fantastic 7 night stay at the rid place times square.fantastic welcome at reception from aime.such an asset to the hotel.very kind,helpful and daring.was upgrade to a beautiful room on the with floor.far view from my room.2026. hotel is prestige throughout.amazing  for.very central location.great food.absolutely loved everything about it.will definitely be back."
31,hotelriuplaza,we had 3 rooms booked for our family trip for my daughters birthday.   request a certain floor and got it and asked for a different room type and got it. fantastic welcoming service in check in.   we booked a junior suite and had access to the lounge which was very welcoming to get bottle water and other supplies. we stayed half board ( also been told it’s stopping soon at the hotel ) and that was a godson.  to save having to go out looking for meals that people wanted to eat. buffets in the morning and night was perfect.   we had people in our party who had never stayed there before and they also loved it.  the breakfast was amazing as usual and loved the mix of going into the main restaurant and quieter one to try different surroundings.   the rooms are very clean and great
32,hotelriuplaza,"great location with key attractions in walking distance,  but plenty of subways and train stations nearby too. room was comfortable  - we were a family of 4 and had enough space. breakfast was busy but lots of choice and well organised.  reasonably prices for new york.  we were very happy.  we stayed 5 nights."
33,hotelriuplaza,"i stayed at the hotel for 5 nights with my teenage daughter . the location of the hotel is great and the rooms are very clean . staff are friendly , especially those who greet customers at the front of the hotels , cleaner  work extremely hard and are always cleaning the floor/walls of the hotel however there was a lot of room for improvement. two water bottles were provided upon check in, there was a sign on the fridge stating that the water would be provided every other day however when asked i was told that this would not be happening and i would have to buy water instead . breakfast wasn’t the best , not as good at the other rid place which is where i stayed last year and absolutely loved . my daughter got locked in a downstairs reception toilet due a faulty lock  , it took"
34,hotelriuplaza,great stay at rid place new york times square. brilliant location and excellent breakfast. room was a little cramped. 2 queen beds pushed together but very clean nonetheless. only one disappointment is security deposit. we have been back 12 days and still not been refused. extremely difficult to get in contact with the hotel to request this.
35,hotelriuplaza,"our and time in new york, stayed at the other rid last time, loved this one too. we were warmly greeted on arrival and check in was quick. we had 2 rooms next door to each other and were impressed with the rooms. they were clean with plenty of storage and nice views. rooms were cleaned every day which was good. breakfast was really good, we didn’t wait long and an excellent choice each day including lots of fresh fruit.  all the staff were friendly and helpful, they assisted us several times with subways directions. the fashion bar is really nice on an evening with excellent service and a good range of drinks - the happy hour is good value. grab bar was handy and a good range of snacks and drinks. we had a fantastic stay and would recommend the hotel to anyone - we will"
36,hotelriuplaza,"great location, right next door to times square! the view was alright, slightly obscured by some less-attractive buildings, but you can almost see the glowing billboards of times square! lots of tourist shops nearby, grocer shops etc. the rooms were quite average- we had a suite, so access to the lounge swell. (we upgrade because the regular rooms are quite small for a family of 5) now complaints: talking of the room- it smelled of cigarettes every time we came back to it after room service visited, strange how smoking is apparently not allowed but the room suddenly develops a stench every few hours. the room keys were problematical- you had to scan them a certain way, you couldn’t walk past a train station (??), you couldn’t put it near your phone (??) (according to the staff)"
37,hotelriuplaza,"the three of us stayed at the rid place between the and and th february 2024. we arrived at check in around 8:pm. the for is lovely and spacious, with vagrant, yet relaxing colours. check in was swift, although as with any city these days, there’s a city tax to be paid. bear this in mind.  also, a $200 refundable fee for room damages (keith moon would have hated this!), which was returned to my wife’s account immediately after we returned to the up, so no worries there.   our room was 2511, located on with floor, which had a nice view of the edge viewing tower, as well as various other skyscrapers. it looked amazing at night. the pick i’ve posted don’t do it justice.  considering the fact you’re in a big city close to all of the hullabaloo, i’ve found the room to be quiet,"
38,hotelriuplaza,just returned from rid place time square. the hotel is clean throughout the bedroom was come although we had to request extra pillows. upon arrival and check in we found the man who checked us in very unfriendly and not welcoming in the slightest throughout our stay no staff members engaged with us smiled or acknowledged us. when we did speak to staff they could barely understand what we were saying yet are suppose to speak english but many cannot. the breakfast included was lovely no complaints but we would have liked a kettle and hot drinks available in our room.  they also need more facilities at the hotel in terms of refreshments and games area. overall it was a nice stay but they definitely need to improve their customer service.
39,hotelriuplaza,"the staff were very friendly. the hotel was very clean throughout. the breakfast was very nice and good selection. it was very busy at breakfast time but the queue moved quickly for us to be seated. our room was on the with floor and at the rear of the hotel. very quiet in the nights except for the occasional person with their door so slept well. beds very comfortable but only a sheet and thin blanket hence 4 stars. we had read there weren't kettles etc provided so we took a travel one with us. there was a hairdryer provided which saved us taking one and it was sufficiently powerful. we would definitely stay again. perfect location for central park, time square and several theaters."
40,thelangham,"my friends & i stopped here after shopping while visiting chicago. we didn’t stay here but enjoyed some good drinks, wine, burghers & fires. views of the river & city are nice. lots of comfortable seating for small or larger groups. good wine selection. i would caution that the prices are not cheap. you will spend some cash here. decorated nicely for the holidays."
41,thelangham,"wonderful stay at the langham. the location right on the river was perfect and very valuable. the hotel staff was kind, and the converge desk in particular was fantastic. first time at the hotel - we would absolutely stay here again. loved the big rooms, and the grm."
42,thelangham,"spectacular tea!!! it’s one of the best in chicago!  the champagne, the tea and the food is all wonderful! the service is snatched!  can’t recommend highly enough! be sure to make reservations early as they book up fast.  they have a piano player, plying throughout its lovely!"
43,thelangham,"had a lovely three day stay at the five star hotel. shout out to main (front desk), enemy (door), phillips (converge) for their superb help and suggestions. listening to the symphony orchestra practicing in millennium park was a spiritual experience. thanks to everyone who helped make this a fabulous stay. thanks- mb miller"
44,thelangham,"i decided to treat my sister to a quick weekend gateway to chicago as neither of us had ever been to this city before. the weekend we visited was right when their restaurant/bars shut back down for indoor dining. despite the shutdown the langham did offer room service or food to go from their restaurant. the langham staff took proper precautions during this time of could by taking temperature checks, ensuring mask were worn, and providing hand sanitizer around the hotel. this hotel is in a great location. it's within walking distance of the famed 'magnificent mile', shopping, and the riverbank. back to the room service... the food and service were great. a little prices, but expected. the room was as described, looks just like the webster. i thought the water carbon that was"
45,thelangham,"the langham is a lovely hotel that is well maintained, beautifully designed and had excellent services.  room was large and very well maintained with a memorable view of the city. bed and bedding was very comfortable, and bathroom was immaculate.  room service is prompt and menu offers very good choice.  this is a very well run hotel with high standards and management and staff should be commended."
46,thelangham,first class from checking to wonderful room to a really good restaurant. cleaning staff excellent  lots of amenities in the room. the front desk staff were attentive and helpful. great location to walk to everything. no flaws.
47,thelangham,fantastic welcome and wonderfully thought out service from start to finish. out converge was attentive and information and available! beautifully appointed room with every detail imaginable. really comfortable bed and toiletries in excess. great in-house restaurant  will not only come back my next time in chicago but will make it a point to visit all langham properties.
48,thelangham,"i stayed here 3 nights with friends over a long weekend and had a lawless experience. every detail is thought of, the room design is both beautiful and functional, amenities are great, and service is warm and thoughtful. location is excellent too - right by the river, close to many great restaurant and bars, shops, and a short walk to many of the main sightseeing areas.   service is #1. there are so many hotels competing for our tourism dollars. no matter how nice a place is, i can't get behind it if the service is bad. at these type of 5 star hotels, sometimes as a younger, racialized woman who may dress casually, i find there can be some subtle attitude or coldness/robbery. not here. i was greeted by name and received warmly throughout my stay.   room: i stayed in a room"
49,thelangham,"first time visitor to this hotel, was very impressed.  the location was great and cab service in and out was never a problem.  room amenities very scale and fresh.  more words required so i'll just keep tying."
50,homewoodsuites,"joshua gave great customer service. he supplied anything i needed, and answered any questions i had being it was my first time staying here. i was taken care of very well while staying here. definitely would come back again and recommend it to my peers. can’t wait to come back again in the future"
51,homewoodsuites,"this is my fifth time in this hotel with my husband, very nice to be back there. the receptionists are very attentive. i thank everyone there for their attention, ana rosário, giovanni, michel and also the friendly iris.  the breakfast has lumen-free bread, i just asked the very polite attendants angelic and elizabeth  bring it on my table. many option of fruits and bread. the room always clean.i also really like the kitchenette, it makes it a lot easier. they take orders from amazon.  i hope to be back soon. thanks."
52,homewoodsuites,"dear homeward team,  we are staying for a week with you and have enjoyed our stay and the friendliness of the staff. we met per at breakfast and he was awesome. he made us a custom breakfast sandwich. he really made the experience special !  all the best,  jowl and kate"
53,homewoodsuites,thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this hotel. it was very generally located to all of the activities we had planned while in the city. every staff member we encountered was wonderful and they tested us multiple times during our 3 night stay to check on us and to make sure all was well. we have not experienced that with other hilton properties and it was a nice touch. the room was very clean and had more room than we expected for a room in ny. the breakfast was great with a lot of variety and they did a great job of replenishing during busy periods. we will definitely stay here again when we return!
54,homewoodsuites,"love the stay! the hotel is very well located, the rooms are comfortable, breakfast are delicious and the view from the and floor trace is so nice. the staff is very kind and helpful. thank you josttym for being there for us daytime :):):):)"
55,homewoodsuites,"our trip to ny was made even more awesome by the professional, efficient, and super friendly service we received from oliver t. and rest of the staff at homeward suites milton ... perfect location, great lobby, helpful front desk folks, and modern, clean rooms."
56,homewoodsuites,"loved the location of this hotel! it was in the middle of everything and great food. we could walk to most popular sights, times square, radio city hall, empire state building and lots more. subways was close by. the staff were friendly and helpful. they always had coffee, tea and hot chocolate available. breakfast was busy but good. lots of choice. we felt very safe in this location. felix was especially friendly and helpful! room was a good size and clean"
57,homewoodsuites,enjoyed our breakfast by the fire in the homer western theme lobby! bill was a friendly server who kept the area stocked & clean. he gave us advice on best times to go to yellowstone. great mountain view from our spacious room!
58,homewoodsuites,"this hotel is in the perfect location if you are going to mug. we loved our stay here, the room was very spacious and came with a full kitchenette. breakfast area was super busy in the morning but had great option to choose from for breakfast. it was also great to have the opportunity to make coffee in the lobby all throughout the day. the staff tested me throughout my stay and made sure i was always taken care of. the front desk held our bags after checkout which allowed us to explore the city for a while before heading home. parking garage was 300 feet away and made it extremely convenient when i picked this hotel. would 100000% stay here again on all my future trips to ny moving forward. highly recommend!"
59,homewoodsuites,"nice clean hotel in a great location because it was quite central to everything.  breakfast time busy but had everything you needed. tea and coffee available all day. what makes this hotel is the staff. they where all lovely, friendly and helpful.  thanks to forge and felix for finding us a seat each morning at breakfast time. all the staff work hard and deserve a mention."
60,thebiltmore,"writing my review from my bed as i’m still staying here. my of and i rented a one month air bob in downtown la until our new place in pacific palisades would be ready. turns out, the air bob is a dump so in the last month we’ve now found ourselves at the baltimore 3 times. each time a better experience than the last. so much history and beautiful things to look at. each time the staff has been warm and welcoming.  but this time i would like to highlight one employee in particular. italian, a server in the gallery bar and conan room.  last night we checked in and entered the bar minutes before pm. it turns out they were holding a once a month gathering for the guests with a lovely cheese and charcuterie plate as well as some nice sea water (mint/cucumber refused). anyway, as"
61,thebiltmore,"customer service was the best! our bell hop was so nice and provided extra information regarding the history of the hotel. we had dinner at the gallery bar and the food was amazing. we had purchased a cake from a different restaurant and asked if they could keep it in their fridge overnight, they did no problem."
62,thebiltmore,"the baltimore is more than a historic hotel; it is an experience. at the baltimore you are treated like special guests. they are accommodation and courteous. add this stay to your bucket list! special thanks to valentine. being able to stand where the first academy awards were held, and of announced his presidential candidacy will forever be remembered. and you'll have to ask about the secret room!"
63,thebiltmore,"the hotel is a historic gem. the whole absence of the place feels like stepping back into a time where beauty mattered. the staff is very kind and outdoing to serve. valentine, specially, gave us a warm welcome and is an amazing source of knowledge. would definitely stay again!"
64,thebiltmore,"perfect room, comfortable and unfordable. very nice hotel. easy to find with easy access to the garage. don’t be afraid of the location. several restaurant and bars near by, or you can just hit up the bar in the lobby. old school atmosphere. check out the pool downstairs!"
65,thebiltmore,beautiful hotel. i am disabled so came for pool and hottub.hottub closed. got lost in a back area trying to find pool. was treated badly when security approached. hotel not set up for walker/ wheelchair access. staff is educated in where disabled access to pool is. first night got stuck on stairs with walker. no one answers phone. restaurant is hospitable. super summed wanted to stay here for 10+ years.
66,thebiltmore,valentine the host tested us very well and gave us a fantastic tour of the ballroom that most guests don't get to see.  he told us stories of when it was used to host the scars in the 1920s and was.  he even showed where alcohol was stuck in through a secret passage with a steam-sunk look in one of the ballroom during prohibition.   the baltimore is a beautiful and enchanting place to stay.  we plan on staying again soon and using the amazing pool that looks like a roman bath.
67,thebiltmore,"this is absolutely a beautiful hotel. i only stayed one night but it was amazing. so much history, so well maintained after all these years. it’s fabulous and i think that you will enjoy it as much as we did. i definitely recommend you stay at this ironic, neat hotel. i would not hesitate to stay any time i am in the area."
68,thebiltmore,"we stayed a couple of nights here midweek.  we arranged an early check in and check in was a breeze, you can always tell a well run hotel by how fast you check in.  this hotel is 101 years old and is a work of art deck design.  from the intricate ceilings to the grand halls it takes you back to an elegant age.  the swimming pool, anna and modern work out machines is a great way to relax.  the hotel is ideally situated to get around down town.  the rooms are comfortable.  finally the staff are top notch and take care of you quickly and efficiently. will definitely we staying here again"
69,thebiltmore,"thank you for making our winter break in los angeles memorable. first of all, the staff are amazing. everyone was very helpful and friendly. second, as stated in many reviews the public areas are outstanding and learning about the history of the hotel/scars was very interesting. don’t miss the swimming pool! third, the rooms maybe smaller than some and the door is a more heavy/ dark style (some furniture was stuffed) and the bathroom is old fashioned but you are in an historic hotel not a genetic “hotel”. besides in the areas that count- cleanliness, comfortable beds, wonderful sheets the room was perfect. we stayed in a club double. finally, the hotel has incredible reasonable prices and its location to the tea museums and walt dinner concert hall is perfect  don’t worry"
70,fairmontdallas,"very friendly staff but old worn down hotel. rooms need to be maintained/renovated, everything is very old and barely working. light did not work in the closet, drain in the tub was almost blocked. 2 out of 3 elevators not working at all. such a bad experience and to such high rate. i would not stay here again."
71,fairmontdallas,"every employee i encountered smiled and greeted me.  check in was swift.  hotel has a boutique vice and spacious rooms. shout out to philip p, chief converge, took extra special care of me and shared how he helps create such a customer central culture."
72,fairmontdallas,the whole experience was disappointing - i've stayed at 3 other fairmont properties this year alone and dallas fairmont is simply not signed with their brand.   upon check-in i received faulty keys - twice!!  this was exacerbated as 2 out of their 3 elevators were out of order which delayed the whole process of actually being able to enter my room. i then tried to order a snack - the in-room dining number rang out 2 times and on the third attempt the person on the phone ultimately mumbled something and then proceeded to tell someone else that room xx needed an iron and something else while i was just was on the line. i placed my order -- when it turned up it had the incorrect beverage.  the gentleman then said it would take 10-15mins to correct - i sent the beverage back with
73,fairmontdallas,the old hotel needs to be updated - the key for did not work half the time and i had it in my wallet - service was just ok loud noise early saturday morning woke us up and nothing appeared to be done about it. will choose someplace else next time - good location - staff was good especially on gold floor
74,fairmontdallas,"in sure this was a great swank place back in the day.  everything needs to be updated.  the rooms are old and need of dating.  the crown holding in my room is falling down.  the shower head leaned and sprayed more water out of the tub/shower than in.  the elevators are horrible.  the wood is in need of major repair and restoration. the elevators were down most of the time, long wait time when they were working.  i got stuck in then twice and the light panel went out.  it was a joke.  lamps broken...the air intake events are absolutely filthy in the rooms and ball rooms just shows you the neglect."
75,fairmontdallas,service and food was amazing. i had the avocado toast with pouched eggs after a 4:am alarm clock and am 3 he flight. the services with met was implacable and he did all the right things checking on me and even offering me a to go cup of coffee which after that 430am alarm was needed! thanks met
76,fairmontdallas,"this is the worst accord hotel i've ever stayed in.  overpriced, pretensions, dated, smell.  i am accord diamond but would never stay there again.    first off, on arrival there were about 10 baggage guns on duty at the front entry that just watched me struggle with my bags.  as soon as you get in to the lobby, you know something is wrong, because of the smell.  mold.  rooms are small, dated, and also smell.  no complimentary water.  just amazingly bad.  i paid extra for lounge access (gold rooms), and just poor overall.   accord hotels - get your act together.   i stay at the fairmont manila several times a year.  infinitely better.  not even in the same league"

78,fairmontdallas,wrapped in elevator between floors for 45 minutes. hotel was so flippant about it. thank god for did for reaching us. 1-hotel night compel and still haven’t heard from any manager yet! lack of compassion is outrageous. never again staying!

80,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,dont ever valet here. which i believe is all you can do to park! i paid $42 for valet just for them to take my car out at 4:am and drive it out of dallas. also the driver who took it was going over lymph. had to contact police since the staff and security was telling me to wait which makes me think they knew what he was doing. he came back and said they moved it to another garage which was false because i was cracking it the whole time. i believe they thought i was asleep and wanted to either steal parts or just drive it around wasting my gas. very disrespectful! they then blamed my pp that i pay dodge for not being accurate. i ended up leaving and they wanted my keys back when i was going to grab my stuff out of the room i didn’t even sleep in. total waste of money and time
81,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"ask for joy at the front desk!  he provided outstanding customer service. joy was always friendly, welcoming, and attentive to our needs. he is knowledgeable about the hotel's amenities and local attractions, and is always ready to offer recommendations and assistance.  joy’s positive attitude and education to guest satisfaction make him an invaluable asset to the hotel team.  i wanted to take the time and make sure to praise him for his exceptional service and warm demeanour.  thank you again joy! you made our stay memorable and we will be back!!"
82,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"this was the worst room imaginable..no exaggeration!  downtown dallas, dec 1-2 shocking bad.   front desk staff were very nice..one even said “and this is supposed to be a 4 star hotel!!” !  broken vent, horrible linens and bed was barely made, dirt in the tub,  no towels, no food service, no minimal, no cocktail lounge..we had user bring wine from a tom thumb! i will let the six speak for themselves. the bathroom was a dirty beauty hellhole.

83,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"if you’re booking a king suite be aware the sofa does *not* pull out to a bed. unlike almost every other hotel i’ve ever stayed in there is no pull out bed, and your third person can sleep on the floor for all they care. they do not offer roll away beds, so if you’re traveling with 3 people and expect a bed for all 3 you’re out of luck. they don’t advise you of this when you check in, despite seeing 3 guests and knowing it’s a king suite.   once my friends and i had checked in, i had to request extra towels (there were 2 shower but only 2 towels) and some sheets to lay on top of the sofa. the front desk person was somewhat rude about my request to send those things up, though the person who brought them was very nice.   there is also no ice bucket in a suite, in spite of the"

89,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,i stayed there with my friends and we booked 1 qu and 1 suite. it was connecting door and best option for family and friends. location is really good. employees are really nice for everything. i tried flatbread at restaurant it was really delicious.
90,omnidallashotel,"now, what a great experience.  i have been in hotels all over the world and this one is by far the very best.   stayed one night for a charity event and was amazed from the time we stepped through the doors.    check in was so professional and quick.  we were right up t our room.     we were in room 2130 not too far from the elevators and we had a great west view.  room was extremely spacious.  large wall mounted to.  lots of storage and closet space.  coffee maker, water, refrigerator, and safe.    the bathroom was large and very nice.  to in the mirror and a full tub.    every staff member that we came across was extremely helpful and friendly.  this is one hotel i will be staying at again in the near future."
91,omnidallashotel,keeping this short and sweet. the parking garage was “full” a lot when it wasn’t and was told to park “nearby”. staff is short and sooty depending what you look like. guest room pillows smell of sweat since they haven’t been washed since original purchase. and bathroom are infested in mold and milder. poor sanitation that clearly travels across the entire hotel.
92,omnidallashotel,"this was the first time we'd stayed at an omne hotel and we weren't disappointed.  efficient valet staff greeted us on arrival.  reception were wonderful. friendly, interested and interesting.  fabulous room way up high with floor to ceiling views of the dallas skyline.  bed was really comfortable and the bath and shower were excellent with plenty of pressure. surprise was a to built into the mirror in the bathroom - never seen anything like the. not a to in the bathroom, but literally part of the mirror!  breakfast in the texas spice restaurant was friendly, taste and set you up well for the day.  we ate in the owners bar restaurant on one evening.  food wasn't bad and the drinks were great served by a fantastic witness.   location here is excellent and genuinely 3 minutes"
93,omnidallashotel,"beautiful, modern hotel. it is next to convention center and has lots of business guests, but hotel is spacious and well laid out-- never seemed crowded or rushed.   staff very attentive and helpful. easy to walk to dealer place.  hotels in downtown are more spread out in dallas than in other cities, but it is still possible to walk to attractions-- 15 minutes to reunion tower, 10 minutes to union station (which appears safe and clean), 20 minutes to dallas art museum.    not many restaurant in walking distance. we like trains and had oblique view of rail traffic from our north facing room, which had a great view of dallas skyline.  our room was clean and quiet.  valet parking expensive but convenient and efficient."

95,omnidallashotel,"when we arrived at this hotel, we chose to park in the parking garage rather than going to the valet. when we approached the hotel doors with our multiple bags, the young man at the valet looked up at us from his phone then continued to look at his phone and ignored us. i’m sure if we had asked him a question he would have helped, but many hotels i go to, the valet rushes to open the door for you. that didn’t happen. i thought this might be a one off, but no, it happened every single time we approached the front door during our stay. they’d look up at us, then ignore us as we walked in. likewise. the woman at the front desk was kind, however, she didn’t provide any helpful information. i left the front desk searching for the elevator because she didn’t tell me where it was. i"

99,omnidallashotel,"great place to stay. staff was very polite and helpful.  the hotel was very clean. the rooms were great, very clean. the only complaint i would have would be the bartenders at the owners box. it was hard to get drinks and pay out."

102,hotelriuplaza,"superb location! the very best. rooms large and plenty of space. disappointing that no tea or coffee in the room, fridge in room.   very helpful staff , clean and spacious.   breakfast a little chronic, very regiment although well organised. plenty of choice and good fresh food as well as the ‘pile it high’ american style.   be prepared to wait for the breakfast, but worth it, all self service buffets style.   reception staff helpful.  be warned the pre wipe of the card on arrival in reception is refused two weeks later , even if you don’t charge to your room.   the traffic noise and silent can disturb your sleep to start with , but you just get used to it! the sound drooping in the rooms could be better.   cleanliness is good in the hotel.  the bar area is quiet but good."
103,hotelriuplaza,really nice hotel very clean and friendly staff also .the rooms are a good size and we had really good views on the top floor. the breakfast is very busy but we always got a table quick the only thing i would say is may the rolls bread and parties would be better separate as they were high  up and i had to lean over the bacon and hot food to get to them i only eat continental so it would just have been easier on a separate counter near the cereal .reception staff very good especially amie who was very helpful had a great time and would recommend as so easy to get everywhere from this hotel
104,hotelriuplaza,"we have just checked out and would definitely recommend this hotel. location is perfect close to everything but not too close as you don't hear the noise from time square. we got a room out the back of the hotel which was nice and quiet we didn't hear a thing during the day or night. the room was big not what i was expecting after reading some reviews. we are a family of 3 and had loads of space there was space under the beds for suitcase a wardrobe and even a sofa. the room was spotless, cleaned every day. the hotel in itself was spotless and well kept in all areas. the staff were all lovely and helpful we had an issue with the window in our room we rang reception and was sorted within a couple of minutes. breakfast was perfect if you are an early riser you miss the que but if"

108,hotelriuplaza,not worth the money.  the rooms are tiny and extremely basic.  no comforts whatsoever.  no room service no restaurant.  it is a very expensive b&b.  location is ok but that’s about it. would not recommend or stay again.
109,hotelriuplaza,"the room was very bare.  there was no dresser for clothes.  there was also no coffee pot in the room.  you had to insert your room key into a slot for the lights to work inside the room.  it was a very awkward set up, the double beds were just about connected together.  when we checked out, my daughter left her stuffed animal on the couch.  i called when i got home to see if it was by any chance turned in by housekeeping, which i was told no and that housekeeping said there was no stuffed animal left behind.  i also sent an email as a follow up and never got a response.  i know they are not responsible for left items, but a response would have taken 2 minutes.  the only plus was the breakfast buffets had a lot for kiss to choose from."
110,thelangham,"my friends and i spent a tuesday afternoon here for high tea. what else can i say besides it was a gorgeous afternoon? the hotel itself is beautiful, stunning even. the tea spread was over the top delicious! the staff was friendly and made the experience fun (not stuffy and judgment like other boutique hotels). if you are looking for a fun, booty, dressed-up afternoon, book reservations for the high tea at the langham!"
111,thelangham,"the hotel is so beautiful, clean, and well kept. perfect location in walking distance of all area active in the downtown area! the staff is over the top with providing extraordinary customer service. the food at club level was delightful."
112,thelangham,"i'd been to the langham in boston and was impressed, so i was expecting something wonderful when i checked in for my recent stay. the langham chicago far exceeded my already high expectations. one of the best hotels in chicago, absolutely lovely service, rooms, and amenities. they go above and beyond and anticipate your needs. worth the price."
113,thelangham,"check in with the club lounge converge, the food on offer for breakfast, afternoon tea, and evening, the footmen, the butler in the club lounge, the rooms, the sea, the location, the cleanliness...you name it, the langham is tops. it was a wonderful pre-christmas escape. sorry to have had to leave. check back here or on their webster for the occasional great deal, like i did."

115,thelangham,"this was our first trip to chicago and our first time staying at a langham hotel. the staff is welcoming and friendly. the hotel is modern and beautifully decorated. we stayed in room 1224. the double room was very clean, has great spaces, with floor to ceiling windows and a beautiful granite bathroom with separate vanity/wardrobe area. bed and linens were comfortable. we ate breakfast and had appetizers & drinks at the hotel restaurant and bar. the food was excellent! i highly recommend this hotel."
116,thelangham,"this was our first stay at the langham, and it didn't disappoint.  the rooms were very modern and the beds and pillows very comfortable.  the fitness room and sea facilities were also very spacious and clean (be sure to check out the heated tile chairs in the sea).  we are used to staying more in the gold coast area which tends to be more noisy at night (silent) so it was a nice surprise that it was more quiet at the langham.  the location is great as you aren't far from gold coast, michigan ave or the loop for theater."
117,thelangham,"amazing service as soon as i stepped out of the cab.  couldn't get a better location.  gorgeous views of the river.  rooms are immaculate.  one of the more beautiful bathroom i've seen with a cool privacy screen between the shower and the bed.  lots of natural light.  best hotel grm i think i've ever seen in a downtown area.  amazing pool.  sea experience was incredible with lots of amenities.  they even have one of th best shops i've experienced.  purchased some great products for my plane ride home.   just walking through the always was a warm experience.  loved the bar area late night, lively with amazing cocktail.  converge was very helpful.  when i told the front desk at check out that we didn't receive water the first night (she asked for feedback) she compel the mind"
118,thelangham,"pretty good, would recommend again, probably will fail me for doing this. however, i have no idea if this hotel is as good as people say it is. it's polly decent, but yea thanks for the help on the project."
119,thelangham,knowledgeable personal professional staff throughout the property. rooms were well appointed and wasteful.  i want to experience every property they own around the globe! the restaurant breakfast was taste and room service efficient and the food was great.
120,homewoodsuites,"very good location and friendly staff. breakfast can be a too due to high number of guests and the food is  average. kitchenette in the room was very useful and it was pretty quiet given the location, which may have been because we were on a high floor.  good place to stay in milton"
121,homewoodsuites,"first time in ny and have to say the location of this friendly hotel/suites is fantastic, the staff are very helpful. the young man on front reception [sorry didn`t get his name] took the time to write down our journeys through the subways which was very helpful to us both. bed and pillows are very comfortable and a well equipped kitchen, tea and coffee available all day at reception. forge and josttym and all the breakfast staff are very helpful and friendly. we would not hesitate to stay at this hotel again in the future and would recommend to friends and family."
122,homewoodsuites,"during my recent trip to ny, i stayed at the homeward suites milton/times square  pro: 1. great location on a quite block th/with and close to both herald square and times square.

123,homewoodsuites,the staff are very friendly and helpful.  especially forge is a nice guy. he is looking that everything is fine on your table at the lunch. he is very helpful and explain us the routes to some important sights in new york city.
124,homewoodsuites,"the hotel is in a good location for seeing the majority of the sites, it was clean and the rooms a really decent size, we had a couple of issues which they sorted straight away. the lobby i would say is small and a little cramped for the amount of people who pass through it on a daily basis. there isn't really a facility for keeping your bags safe or one that i would feel keeps them safe if you are leaving a lot later than check out and still want to go out of the hotel. breakfast is decent, i would say the hot food is what lets it down. my wife is lumen intolerant and there was plenty of option for her including fresh puffing and wages, special shout out to joshua at breakfast for helping with these every morning and always been welcoming and happy to help every morning."
125,homewoodsuites,"the breakfasts were varied and all very delicious. the staff are very welcoming and understanding. the rooms are beautiful, and the hotel is perfectly located. i would recommend 100%, next trip i will return to this hotel! lots of love to forge who gave us an excellent service!❤️"

127,homewoodsuites,"oliver the horseman in the lobby was awesome helpful very bright, nice smile, deserves a raise or a promotion made my stay special  he was a great help with our family  he went out of his way to help us and especially keep the lobby clean"
128,homewoodsuites,"generally located, quiet and clean. breakfasts were a bit underwhelming. having said that the staff worked like groans. special mention to forge and joshua who were courteous and polite no matter how demanding the patrons were. really enjoyed the wed supper. the fruit, cheese and biscuits and chicken soup were delicious and the young man serving it ( sorry i forgot your name) was extremely helpful in giving us good tips about the city."
129,homewoodsuites,"this was a trip to mark my wife’s landmarks birthday, and as a hilton honors gold member i sent an email to the hotel before to enquire if a room upgrade was available.  i received a very pleasant response and was indeed upgrade to a balcony room.  on checking in, we were warmly welcomed by charles, given a welcome gift of snacks and water.   on entry the room, we were delighted to find a hand written birthday card for my wife along with a lovely bag of treats. what a nice touch.  we have stayed at several homeward suites properties in florida, and are familiar with the brand. however with space in manhattan being so expensive, this suite was smaller, but had all the essentials we needed. one small thing to remember is that the fridge is alongside the bed, and  can be a little"
130,thebiltmore,"the hotel was very nice as you walked in however the rooms were very outdated and the bathroom were very small with a poor shower. it was in a good location and staff were friendly and helpful. the hotel could definitely do with upbraiding the rooms to match the rest of the hotel, however the beds were come."
131,thebiltmore,"we had a 3 night stay at the baltimore, and although it was ok, we had expected more from such an ironic hotel.  the 2 unanswered email i sent asking for information prior to arrival should have been a warning.  reception staff were not interested in their guests nearly to the point of simply being rude. although we had booked a double room, reception told us there were none available.  he then suddenly found one when i told him it was booked 6 months prior, and they had not answered my email. the room was ok but had not been updated in a very long time time.  that said, it was spotless clean. location the location, although historic, is dangerous, especially at night; plan on getting users for every journey as the nearest underground station is frightening.   the converge"

133,thebiltmore,"we arrived at the hotel early due to our flight times and couldn’t check in, not a problem we just wanted to get some food. we asked where to go and the rude receptions just gave some vague directions down the road. after returning to check in we were “greeted” by michel, someone with a customer facing role that clearly has a problem with customers! he told us that we had to pay a deposit but all fees had been paid in advance. after much eye rolling from him we got our keycards and nothing else, no information about the hotel, water, breakfast times, location of restaurant, location of lifts etc. he is an expert at doing the minimum! the room was dirty, the bathroom door filthy and the floor had glitter/equino from previous guests. we had a couple of drinks in the bar on both"
134,thebiltmore,"location is okay for la.  it’s central, but you will require a car to get to attractions or public transport if it’s able.  car parking is $50 per night which is unacceptable on all accounts and is pretty insulting.  if you have a car and using this hotel, there is a car park around the corner than charges $20 per day, or $10 dollars per night after pm for 8 hours.  again, “tax and inclusive” charges also apply which is daylight robbery for the entire us.  i would choose a different hotel personally that has cheaper parking and more central to your needs."
135,thebiltmore,"it was great staying here... loved the grand feel of everything!! bed was very come an pillows were oh so soft!! everything was nice and clean, couldn't have asked for a better stay!! breakfast at smeraldis was delicious! would recommend to anyone!"
136,thebiltmore,"what a memorable stay!  we came for two nights to enjoy a concert at the dinner concert hall and to ring in the new year.  the los angeles baltimore is an architectural and historical treasure.  treat yourself by staying here and do give yourself plenty of time to wander its allowed halls.  check-in was fearless as was check-out.  thank you, madura and angelo.  our room was very spacious - tip: request a larger room if available when you book - and it even had a walk-in closet.  both sash windows opened for fresh air.  we also enjoyed the white tea shower get.  the bed was extremely comfortable and well dressed.  as for the baltimore’s location, we were a 6-minute walk to the dinner concert hall, the broad museum, mock, restaurant, and cases.  all this to say that is was more"
137,thebiltmore,the rooms are comfortable and spacious . the staff is very nice and polite. we stayed 11 days and they made us feel like we were home. the hotel is gorgeous. it is like staying at a museum. highly recommend it. thank you millennium baltimore hotel for making our first visit to la a memorable one. see you again in the future. we will definitely be back to la and stay at your wonderful hotel.
138,thebiltmore,"this gorgeous art deck hotel is a gem. we enjoyed the old-school, high-end service and the beautiful facilities. the location is a little sketch (tea), but the hotel is valuable to great restaurant, museums, and architectural sites like city hall, dinner concert hall, the broad. save $ by parking in the pershing garage."
139,thebiltmore,"thank you so much paul! we appreciate your help and your kindness! from the moment we wanted in the door, you were there with a smiling face to chat, tell us about the area, help with our bags, got us all settled in and we even got to bond over where we’re from! we just wanted to make sure you’re taken care of and shown the love that you deserve!"
140,theplaza,"a wonderful bucket list experience. while the surroundings are indeed amazing, that really is what you pay for. the sandwich’s and deserts  were outstanding but such tiny portions. i am willing to overlook this to say i finally had afternoon tea at the place hotel. porfirio was a wonderful server, i’d be happy to see him should i visit again."
141,theplaza,got afternoon tea at the place. had the pleasure of having far tell as my waiter and he was phenomena. i love how the tea was christmas theme and it felt so magical here. highly recommend you get afternoon tea here the month of december!
142,theplaza,the footman was very reluctant to let me in. i explained that i was meeting my wife who was at her firm's christmas party. he was very sceptic until i told him the company's name (a very prestigious ny law firm) then he was happy to let me in. i asked him if i could get a drink while i was waiting and he told me that all the bars were 'full to capacity' but i could wait in the lobby! i went in and the palm court bar was less than half full and the maitre d' was very charming and showed me to a table immediately. i would suggest that their door staff receive some customer service training?
143,theplaza,wonderful experience dining at the palm court. valid chowdhury was my server assistant at the palm court and did a wonderful job - attentive and polite. wonderful experience and can never beat the alliance.
144,theplaza,"the place hotel, one of the most celebrated addresses in ny ......especially around was. this grande dame of a property is surrounded by central park, fifth avenue, shopping, dining and ny boisterous night-life. it's inside shops are considered a micro fifth avenue and this was the primary reason i went to the place. just for fun i jockey up to reception to gauge what a one-of-a-kind suite would ring in at....the price brought tears to my eyes. enjoying the delights of the place is way above my financial grade.  so, if you wield a strong wallet and want to stay at an ironic hotel slam-bang in the heart of everything ny...............then try the.................. place new york...............a famed ny hotel."
145,theplaza,"this was my first stay at the place.  my parents stay at the place very often and sadly this time they took care of my stay.  to start with, the hotel is very old and you can hear air system sound very loud every night, as the system is right next to bed.  the house keeping only fixed my bed and touched nothing at all, no water refreshing, no towel refreshing. overall, no consistency in anything.  one they they serve coffee, the other day they do not. you always have to mention you are a hotel guest for them to give you coffee. they don’t even ask you if you are a guest. there is always a no at every conversation. hospitality is something they never heard of.  i shared my horrible experience with the hotel stuff and manager but i didn’t even hear a single sorry. all i got as a"
146,theplaza,"staying at the place has always been on my bucket list, so i decided to book a 3 night stay on a recent impromptu trip to new york.  the location is fantastic- at the foot of central park, within easy walking distance of times square, the rockefeller centre, natural history museum, avenue of the american and so many other manhattan hotspots. taxi from of took about an hour but only 30 mind in the early hours to get back (usual manhattan set fare applies). there several subways stations nearby.  the staff were wonderful from arrival to departure- everyone was very friendly and courteous.  my room was very spacious, always clean and elegantly & elaborate decorated- i particularly liked the chandelier. the bed was comfortable, the lighting was good but a bit confusing to"
147,theplaza,the room was beautiful and lots of space.  the hotel is beautiful. staff are friendly and helpful.  breakfast and drinks while there were great.  location is the best and central park and th avenue are a step away
148,theplaza,"i went to this hotel because it was in my bucket list, it is beautiful and ironic property. this is the best option to stay in new york. the hotel it’s amazing and the reception team it’s very warm. i will come back here."
149,theplaza,"high tea at the place was such a perfect birthday gift to myself.  it was so elegant, and everything was very delicious!  thank you baby n. for being perfectly attentive! you made my visit extra special!"
150,theadolphus,"the hotel offers everything you could desire. its facilities are opulence and comfortable, creating an unparalleled alliance. the rooms are spacious, with carefully designed details to ensure a pleasant stay, and their hosts are top-notch—friendly and respectful. mr. per made us feel right at home. always willing to assist, per ensued that every aspect of our stay was perfect."
151,theadolphus,"we attended a wedding at the adolphus and the venue was amazing. it was truly a fairy tale wedding. the  staff were all extremely courteous. we were running late to check out and than was the bell hop that loaded all our bags. he was very kind and so helpful. he did all the work for us with a smile and helped us get on the road on time. drops to than and all the staff at the adolphus. if you ever need to stay in downtown dallas, this is your hotel!"
152,theadolphus,"blue was a foot! my mon, his, and i had a girls day/night out at the adolphus! we went to this bar and she was so inviting!  the drinks were great and the vice is warm and fun!   definitely a place to hang out in the day and night. it’s connected to the hotel which is a plus!!"
153,theadolphus,"came in for drinks and spent the afternoon with blue. down to earth, great drink and food recommendations and will be back to spend time with her at the rode bar! the wings were a hit. also had the old fashioned and the pink drink. brought out some banana pudding on the house."
154,theadolphus,"check in at this lovely hotel was a dream. the valet was very nice. and jay, our porter, was so so polite. he offered us water and handled our luggage with care. this is our first time to stay and really looking forward to our time at the adolphus hotel dallas."
155,theadolphus,"we had an amazing stay and enjoyed every moment at the adolphus. what a beautiful hotel. luxury at its best. our friends posted a gorgeous wedding reception here and it was magical.   all the staff were great, especially per who was most friendly and helpful. he was always present to help us.   thank you! we will be back."
156,theadolphus,"this is the coolest hotel in dallas. the vantage but party atmosphere ! i was first concerned because the property is older but after my experience, i will not use old, i’ll use seasoned. the service from the moment you , park, thank you valet, to the pullman jay, to the welcoming from the front desk samantha. i experienced a few issues but the moment i called to addressed them, their guest services phone team was professional. i expected long wait times for my request and complaints but contra kept following up with me and provided actual times. usually other hotels will say “in 5 minutes”. no, she informed me a particular time the engineering and house keeping services was going to assist me. the staff is professional. i will love to meet you contra next time i travel. mr"
157,theadolphus,great and attentive service! awesome atmosphere had a blast!  the room was nice and the bed was super come!  the room was really clean and the bar downstairs was lively.  the room service was great and jay was super nice!  will definitely return!
158,theadolphus,"this is a lovely historical luxury hotel located in downtown dallas. our arrival was a little before 7 pm, and once we pulled into the valet area, we were immediately greeted. i was a little concerned about entering the hotel to access the lobby area. it was not as warm and inviting. walking through a parking garage isn't ever any fun, and although it was only just a few steps to the door, i didn't feel as though i was being welcomed into what proved to be a gorgeous and beautifully appointed luxurious, historical hotel.  now, we waited about 5 minutes to be greeted at guest registration which is somewhat unusual for a hotel of this calibre. once someone did come out from the back office, we were acknowledged and were nicely advised that they would be with us shortly. there was"
159,theadolphus,the adolphus is a 10/10 experience! amazing coffee shop and bar with the perfect alliance. valet provided 10/10 customer service. special shoutout to kenneth branch who works in valet who gave exceptional service. we will definitely be coming back.
160,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"my husband and i booked a nights stay at magnolia and everything was good until we decided to shower prior to an evening out for dinner.  the shower water never completely got hot and to top it off,  there was an extremely slow water drain in the shower.  because it was so slow,  of course,  a few seconds into your shower,  the tub is filling up.  it was really disgusting!  since we had dinner reservations,  we didn't have the time to go down to the desk to try and switch rooms.  my thoughts,  if room service is actually cleaning the shower,  they were absolutely aware of the issue,  so why even put someone in that room.....  😫"
161,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"picked this hotel initially due to its close proximity to the places we were wanting to visit. we were upgrade to a suite unexpectedly and had a wonderful view of the city. perfectly clean, no complaints on the room or staff at all. would definitely visit again."
162,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,thank you marcus for taking care of us! very professional and courteous! the hotel was great and gave us a free room upgrade. we could not have asked for a better anniversary weekend in dallas. thank you !
163,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"horrible customer service. the room was old and dirty (blood on the sink and hair in the sheets). there was only a single towel in the room in a double room, and when we asked for more (3 times) - we were told they didn’t have any because of “supply chain issues”. same when i asked for a single pen. there was also vomit in the elevator that wasn’t cleaned up for hours. do yourself a favor and book at hampton inn and suites down the street. we switched hotels after the first night, and the staff here couldn’t be nicer or more helpful."
164,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"our stay was just incredible. the staff were all so helpful and friendly. the room and location were all fabulous. a full gardensize tub, wonderful historic building, easy access to such a fun part of dallas. thank you!"
165,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,beautiful old building. great local.  not well appointed.   spent a lot of money to stay here.  no wash cloths or hand towels in bathroom. no hair dwyer.  king suite size is good but door is tired.  no restaurant or bar open in hotel.  no parking.
166,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"the hotel and room were lovely, but the customer service was underwhelming. the magnolia’s location is convenient and our view was great, but back to the remarkable and basically responsive guest service was disappointing, to say the least."
167,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,my husband and i arrived for check in and decided to valet. we walked in to get our room keys and drop bags off in the room. the bed was made and towels were folded but nothing else was cleaned. the bathroom was disgusting with hair all over the bathtubs and toilet. it was almost like housekeeping didn’t clean anything! the shower didn’t drain properly so as i showered i was standing in a puddles of water. i wouldn't normally think that walls would need to be wiped down but the hotel room walls were gross! there were three windows in the room with shades and only one worked when pulling up. we wanted to see outside and we couldn’t even get it to stay. as we were leaving for dinner we went downstairs to tell the front desk and he wrote everything down. coming back to the hotel no
168,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"we had a blast with wake ! he remembered us from earlier in the night and even stayed open late to help us celebrate our anniversary! i encourage you to only travel here on friday and saturday nights just so you can get his amazing service! he was friendly , attentive, great at popping drinks and fun! thank you again wake for everything"
169,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"valet only parking, but fast and convenient. hotel is almost 100 years old but recently updated. room was spacious and beds were comfortable. absolutely zero noise from outside the room. highly recommend and will return."
170,theplaza,"a royal weekend treat celebrating my daughter, heloise's with birthday in the same named ""heloise suite""; everything was extravagant, from the welcoming at reception to the gifts and bodies discovered in the suite upon our entry; the staff carried around and made certain our heloise was recognized on her special weekend; the touch of chocolate treats, heloise-theme luxuries and attention to detail stretched her smile beyond limits; a visit to the place boutique offered the opportunity to bring the other heloise home to michigan as we filled our bags with tiny keepsakes that will be cherished for years to come; and of course the palm court, which brought forth so many divine and flavorful dishes that left us ... happy!  an all around fantastic weekend, only too sad to see the two"
171,theplaza,what a disappointing experience at every turn. even from making the reservation and fighting to get someone on the phone to book the home alone package. this place is very special to us as we got married here. we had been so excited to take our kiss here even though we live in ny. we booked the home alone package as our kiss live the movie. we called the converge to ask for special amenities to be in the room on arrival. he told us that the in room dining department would call us as they handle this. they never called despite many calls and email by us. we had arranged for the ice cream sunday from the movie which was part of the package to be in the room upon check in. when we checked in they told us they canceled the order because they didn't know when the room would be
172,theplaza,my son and i traveled to the place for a quick trip before school started back. it’s not hyperbole when i tell you there is no greater experience than staying at the place!  daniel brigand and his entire guest experience team made our overnight stay completely unforgettable!  i loved it so much i stopped by to say to daniel on a recent trip to ny and he was just as hospitable!!
173,theplaza,a lovely decade place to go for tea. the cucumber sandwiched are excellent. the deserts? fabulous. i love a place where you can have a strong breakfast cocktail without judgement. we lover our server-  far is a gem. 10/10 great place to go.
174,theplaza,"had a great time at the palm court for afternoon tea with my family… shall khan our server made the experience unforgettable! the food was amazing, especially the macarons with cavity. the service was great as well. we felt taken care of and would come back soon!"
175,theplaza,first time stay at the place hotel and it did not disappoint.  we loved our room and the hotel was beautifully decorated for valentine’s day.  we attended afternoon tea.  shame khan was a wonderful waiter.  he made our entire experience fabulous!
176,theplaza,the service at the palm court for tea was so lovely. the staff treated my daughter who was getting the heloise tea so sweetly and made her feel so special. it was such a wonderful experience because of the serves and hostess. will return soon!
177,theplaza,"lots of unexpected charges. $65 “urban experience” fee. they said i would get $50 to use at the hotel per day. used on snacks in the room, then they told me that wasn’t covered as we were checking out. ordered the even sunday for my kiss. 3 of the smallest scoop of ice cream i’ve ever seen for $36 then they charged $12 “delivery fee” to deliver it to the room. keys didn’t work on check-in. had to make 4 trips to the lobby to get it straightened out. dingy rooms. nothing great about the hotel. didn’t even have coffee maker in the room. if you want to waste your money, stay here. otherwise, smart travelers will go elsewhere."
178,theplaza,"i’ve only been here 1 night so far and the service has been incredible we came down to breakfast and a lovely man named kari was our waiter he is so lovely and helpful, taking our photo bringing me a birthday cake (at breakfast!) and just a really great person. thank you!"
179,theplaza,"valid chowdhury was brilliant the first day, but when he remembered everyone and what they ordered on subsequent days, we were blown away.   it’s been a few years since we were last at the place, but valid is the place service memory.   we loved our stay, except for your elevators.  very disappointing elevators."
180,homewoodsuites,fantastic room and with the outdoor terrace is an awesome experience  staff super friendly on a super busy hotel on a great spot of the city. from welcoming staff to checking out staff like jefferson was an awesome experience.  not my first time here but definitely this hotel and the convenience of kitchen is a exceptional experience
181,homewoodsuites,"really nice hotel, with very professional and friendly staff. but was mildly surprised to find that the fn news channel was ""out of service - please tune to alternative channel"" makes you wonder why all other news channels were available but just that one was not a choice."
182,homewoodsuites,josttyn was very kind to me! i would like to come back to see him again! the room was spacious and the breakfast was delicious!  room was spacious and comfortable coffee was always available  thank you!
183,homewoodsuites,"the treatment is very scale, the employees are helpful and always smiling. i was happy to deal with the hotel, whether from the general manager and the rest of the employees eighteen  as well as josttym thank you very much all and for sure i will recommend to all my friends ."
184,homewoodsuites,"i had a pretty decent experience. was able to check in through my phone and access my room before i reached the hotel which was great. the lobby was nice and inviting. didn’t have to wait in any lines or come in contact with anyone. just went straight to my room!   the staff, although i didn’t have to come in contact with them that much, were good. it really does help & makes a big difference when you have enough staff to cover different areas throughout the hotel!   it is a safe hotel. you have to use your room key for everything!  the complimentary breakfast was ok. glad they had different option (cold & hot) available. the option were on the wealthier side. a variety of fruits to choose from……… eggs, potatoes, turkey & chicken sausage, turkey bacon, french toast, pancake,"
185,homewoodsuites,"this hotel is old, in a desperate need of removed. front desk people don’t dress very professionally. but the worst part is the room with mold, and the chairs that dumpsters won’t accept. why is this dishonest company hilton putting their name on it?. ."
186,homewoodsuites,"i’ve stayed in this hotel well over a dozen times, and it will continue to be my first choice of hotel in ny. i just noticed a couple of things this last stay: first, the rooms are starting to look a bit worn, which is not surprising given that i don’t think they’ve been refreshed in the 10 years or so i’ve been staying there. second, the corner of with and th, while always a bit sketch with folks sleeping on the sidewalk, had folks shooting up in public, which is the first time i’ve seen that steps from the hotel. (i go to san francisco a lot, so unfortunately it’s not an unfamiliar sight; i just hadn’t experienced it outside the homeward before.) i will still stay here; i will just hope things improve a bit in the coming year. this was my third stay at this hotel in a"
187,homewoodsuites,"great hotel and service.  the room was nicely furnished for it's size with all the amenities (kitchenette, utensils, plates, bowls, etc) you'd expect from the hilton brand.  the staff at the property have been very helpful."
188,homewoodsuites,as soon as you walk in the door they are very hospitable from the front desk (especially mania)to the service at breakfast and house keeping very well kept would highly recommend for a long stay to a weekend gateway.it’s very well situated in times square area easy to get anywhere from there.
189,homewoodsuites,"homeward does a great job here in manhattan. when i come here for work it feels like home. a big part of that is nice h and his service team. as dirty as the big apple is, he keeps this place spotless and orderly. very much an oasis in the chaos."
190,thebiltmore,"i was in los angeles on a business trip and the baltimore hotel was an excellent choice of places to stay. service was excellent and check-in was effortless and timely. staff was friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. the hotel is located in an area of town with abundant shopping and wonderful places to eat."
191,thebiltmore,"valentine was amazing. i was originally given a room that someone else was staying in and had to move, which the hotel was not very apologetic about.  but the day i checked out, i encountered valentine several times and he was always in a great mood, making the guests laugh, and improving everyone’s day. every business should be lucky enough to have a valentine on their staff."
192,thebiltmore,i stayed at the baltimore for a work trip and my experience was amazing. the hotel is beautiful and it’s close to everything. great drinks at the bar and the staff is friendly. valentine was so helpful. he gave me a tour of the hotel and some of the history behind it. my worker and i had a 5 star experience!!
193,thebiltmore,the location is great for walking the downtown area especially for the price. the history of the hotel is unique and fascinating. we did the lip tour la that picked us up on olive street as recommended to us but would not recommend it to others.
194,thebiltmore,"i love this hotel and its alliance. this is my second time here. walking distance to convention center. elegant, spacious -  old world glamour, comfortable and spacious bedroom friendly staff. excellent value also. just beware facility fee in small print."
195,thebiltmore,"i arrived a pm, they rooms available but a $50 early check in was required. i gave my bags to the pullman to be picked when i checked in. after i finally checked in, i was directed to the bell desk and waited 15 minutes in full view of check in desk, she did not offer help until i went back up to desk. the hotel was a lovely old place. the room was not so lovely. the old single pane windows allowed all the street noise in, the window hills were trotting out. the air conditioning blew right on my bed, i finally rigged up a bath towel and dangers to defect the air. i asked for no housekeeping two different times (i was there 5 nights) and housekeeping showed up every day😖. there were no “do not disturb signs in the room. i would not recommend this hotel."
196,thebiltmore,what a beautiful and old hotel rich in history and customer service. it was wonderful .the architecture and staff and amenities are beautiful and i would stay here again. the area is central to restaurant and in the heart of downtown.
197,thebiltmore,"i was pleasantly surprised to find such a competitive rate at this majestic beauty. my stay was absolutely perfect. incredibly comfortable beds, linens and the pillows! friendly staff. i can’t imagine staying anywhere else in downtown la and i’m a sucked for 100 year old pools still fearlessly in operation."
198,thebiltmore,"the hotel is beautiful and very well taken care of in the public areas. the staff were nice. the rooms are older with most basic needs, but barely fit my add needs. i requested feather free bedding when i booked. they said my room would be set up with feather free bedding but it wasn’t. they made it right, but i had to be in a room with feather pillows for an hour. not ideal when you’re allergic. because there are limited outlets in the rooms, there wasn’t one next to the bed for my cap, let alone anything else. i had to string a lamp across the room (it had an outlet on it,) then plug my device in."
199,thebiltmore,"over all it was a great experience. a gentleman was a little too serious about guests looking into the open ballroom, but valentine was more than pleasant to make up for the deficit. this location is a true gem in the heart of tea."
200,homewoodsuites,"i love this hotel, so much, it is clean,  close to the attractions, every time that i come to new york i stay here!  the service is good, especially in the food area. there was a guy named jousttyn, who was amazing helping us.! i highly recommend this place, you won’t regret it.!"
201,homewoodsuites,"the beds are nice and soft, nice service and the breakfast is amazing. the location is right in manhattan and is very close to all the shops and time square. forge gave us the best experience while eating the nicest breakfast, you should give him a pay rise."
202,homewoodsuites,"very impressed with the overall hotel, room is really good! the staff is very friendly specially josttyn who clean all the tables in the breakfast and paid attention on everything me and my mon needed. the front desk was always helpful and even had a social with food on wednesday. recommend 10/10 and will stay here more times."
203,homewoodsuites,felix is the best housekeeper! he is so kind and nice ! thanks for everything felix! i recommend felix as housekeeper because he is always available and do everything to make you happy of your stay in the hotel! thank you felix i hope to see you again !
204,homewoodsuites,"i find this hotel to be perfect for 2 or 3 day visits to ny. great location close to penn station, broadway and shopping. spacious rooms with kitchenettes. free breakfasts. but the staff are what truly make this hotel special. from the time we arrived until checkout, we received warm, personal attention. special shout out to melanin, donnaven, and annabelle."
205,homewoodsuites,"we had a great experience here! rooms are clean and very spacious! we were in a double, and it even had a small kitchenette with a large fridge. being a food clergy family, we like to bring our own food so it was nice having enough room for everything. the hotel also served a hot breakfast in the morning. there was plenty of food and more than enough option. there was also staff taking away plates as you finished with them. felix especially was kind and helpful and made sure that we had everything we needed."
206,homewoodsuites,"we are delighted to have stayed at this hotel. we received a quality room and perfect service. thanks to josttyn for his good humor and his service at breakfast.  good address, good experience, we recommend"
207,homewoodsuites,"i had a lovely lady called  aren, directed me around new york, we arrived  friday she give us an amazing welcome in that she understands how i  felt. aren also help where to go to health shop that i was think about but didn’t know how to find the places, what a wonderful women god bless her"
208,homewoodsuites,"josttyn was friendly and helpful- 5 it feels like home away from home. ❤️ very clean. great breakfast!  the room is very clean. the essentials in the bathroom that like the shampoo, conditioned, get, and lotions were wonderful. definitely a copy feel"
209,homewoodsuites,"great customer service by forge every morning from breakfast, a good variation of breakfast and great help from the night shift team to get us back into our room when we were locked out, overall fabulous base for our new york adventures."
210,hotelriuplaza,"the hotel is very conveniently located just a block away from times square and short walking distances to many great bars and restaurant. the rooms are small but clean and functional, the staff was very accommodation and friendly. the lines into the breakfast room in the morning are very very long and the wait is unacceptable. we choose to have our breakfast in a coffee place accord the street. overall a great place to stay"
211,hotelriuplaza,small but clean and cosy room. friendly staff. convenient location a stones's throw from time square. abundant breakfast buffets. neat queue to get in at peak times but still quick. simple check-in and check-out operations.
212,hotelriuplaza,"this is an excellent option in milton manhattan, the hotel is very conveniently located just a few min from times square, has a gorgeous view from the higher floors, the reception and service were excellent and the room was spotless clean. super fast wife connection included for free. what i loved the most was the amazing buffets breakfast included in the price of the room (which you almost never get in the us). i often travel for work reasons and i have slept in manhattan before, both for work and leisure, but this is by far the best price-quality-service option i have ever experienced. a true gem in the heart of manhattan. it is particularly suitable for european's and tailor to their taste and habits, you will feel very welcome and at home here. love the network and design"
213,hotelriuplaza,"not very satisfied about the place. rude staff, except one young guy at the lobby  prices are indeed to high for the service i received  would not go again when in ny  plus: location is very close to downtown"
214,hotelriuplaza,"my flight got in late. the person who checked me in took awhile because hotel tonight? or he was new? was hoping to sleep in until noon but was women by constant drilling noise starting at am. this is not ok. this is from the with floor!  not sure if i can work from here. thought i could ignore the noise. but not sure.  nice door. but for the price paid, $665/night kind of disappointed in the pillows and lack of amenities (no tips, make removed cotton)"
215,hotelriuplaza,"we had an excellent stay here and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. excellent! good location. clean, safe and friendly neighbors and staff outside, friendliness of staff, good breakfast. great place to stay, close to key points of the city."
216,hotelriuplaza,i thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. i believe it was a lady named lord who checked us all in and we were very impressed with her and the rest of the staff. they are all very organised and welcoming they really make the hotel worth staying at.  it was also nice to see such a wide range of choice for the breakfast buffets. i would have given 5 stars for every category but the owners should invest a little on maintenance in this wonderfully position and well stuffed hotel.
217,hotelriuplaza,"very pleasantly surprised at this hotel. well located and helpful staff. very busy breakfast area, but so many lovely restaurant and cases close by and just a short walk to the dirty times square. i would definitely stay here again, purely because of the convenience. great price for this city."
218,hotelriuplaza,"george at the front desk was very courteous, helpful & accomodating ! he made sure our stay was comfortable.he got us a king bed & higher floor upon our request. the breakfast was so huge ! we really enjoyed our stay. we will definitely come here again & again! my husband comes ny very often for his business trip so he will for sure stay at this hotel."
219,hotelriuplaza,"lord at the front desk is an angel. she is a pro's pro. the check-in process was a breeze, she explained everything in detail, from fees to the amenities and restaurant schedules. i am super grateful for her service as she really set up everything better than i could have asked for.  the hotel is in an awesome location, the rooms are super clean and i would definitely stay here again and again."
220,virginhotels,"the hotel is conveniently located near the cat train station and near lots of restaurant and activities.  the staff is welcoming and efficient.  they take the time to make sure your stay is special.  an umbrella, you mat and mind bar are a few of the amenities that go above and beyond to ensure a peaceful and productive stay."
221,virginhotels,"amazing rooms with large shower - rain shower and a lot of extra - umbrella, robes, you maps, automatic lighting, super clean! and staff was soon friendly and helpful! highly recommend! i came downstairs for the morning and they immediately asked me if i needed a cab/user ... just so accomodating! loved it here! i want to come back soon!"
222,virginhotels,its's a very charming hotel and well located. the rooms are good size and great housekeeping. i didn't have chance to try the room service.  i would like to leave a special thank you to dandy (front desk). he is super efficient and sweet.  i can't not forget aaron from miss rich's restaurant who helps me a lot too! thank you.
223,virginhotels,"the virgin hotel in chicago has such a nice feel. beds are exceptional. staff, dandy at the front desk in particular, really makes the hotel feel warm and inviting.the restaurant downstairs offers very good food. the bar area on the second floor is a nice place for a drink too."
224,virginhotels,"from check-in to check-out, implacable service and amenities at the property.   spotless and well appointed rooms, killer coffee and wages, rooftop bar that had a great vice.  would be a miss to not call out the super friendly, helpful staff.  had in particular wasn’t just an empty suit behind a desk.   made me truly feel like a guest which can be a lost art in hospitality these.  i won’t be staying anywhere other than virgin when visiting chicago.  thank you virgin staff!"
225,virginhotels,"came for work conference at the hotel. room was perfect, venue was great for the meetings. staff was terrific all around.  special buds to had edwards at front desk for helping me print some docs on the fly."
226,virginhotels,"i had the pleasure of interesting with barrel at the hotel front desk, and i must say he exceeded expectations. despite a long and firing travel day, his kindness and patience were remarkable. barrel's cheerful demeanour, coupled with a well-timed funny joke, made my work trip much more enjoyable. buds to barrel for exceptional service!"
227,virginhotels,"the hotel is clean. central. friendly and attentive staff. the rooms are clean, functional and quiet. my only slight complaint is the spongy mattress but once you’re in bed i got a great nights sleep. really enjoyed miss rocky’s next door and had great service from broke."
228,virginhotels,"top-notch stay, which really made my trip special!   i was given an early check-in, and told i was getting an upgrade to a beautiful suite by say. i had four different spots to perch my lawton on around my spacious three-room suite ahead of my conference... looked at the poor guns with conference badges on in their rooms across the street -- so cramped for their video calls.   they also gave me free breakfast credits and printed out some papers that i needed to take with me. felt very spoiled by the whole experience and keep on telling all my friends and family how they should stay there, too."
229,virginhotels,i enjoyed staying here for about 5 days. its location was great for going to restaurant and other downtown attractions. the hotel amenities were modern and fun. the staff were all friendly and personal.
230,thebryantparkhotel,"i was treated like royalty from the moment i drove up at night in a rental vehicle stuffed with personal belongings for my move from north carolina to manhattan. dominion led the team (including julie and jose) that cheerfully and quickly unloaded everything, taking most of it to a storage room where it remained for two days (very few hotels offer such a service). scott at the front desk also gave me a warm welcome and checked me in quickly. dominion and crew then took the overnight luggage upstairs to my room. and, oh my, what a room! the view of bryant park (from the three tall windows of the upper floor corner room) all lit up for the christmas season was stunning! and the bathroom with full tub, large shower, and two more large windows was amazing too. the bed was super"
231,thebryantparkhotel,"for me personally, bryant park hotel is the best hotel in the world (from my travels in the us, europe, australia, and asia). the words i associate with the bah are: class, warm, home, sophisticated, comfortable, friendly, cheery, happy, bright, well located, accommodation. my spirits lift every time i walk in the front entrance. i've stayed here solo and with my family several times since 2012. i stayed for an extended period in dec 2022 and didn't get around to writing my review before i returned for a short visit solo in march 2023. in december, it was magical looking out onto the winter wonderland in bryant park and was lovely being toast and warm in my bright and cheery suite when it was icy and miserable out. my trip ended abruptly in december and i had to rush back on"
232,thebryantparkhotel,"what a surprise. along the past four decades, i have stayed at most the new city hotels that can easily be named, from the now gone place to the soto grand to the st. legs. the bryant park was such a wonderful surprise: fantastic location, and what a room a had. lawless service, with a shout out to josephine at the front desk. will return soon."
233,thebryantparkhotel,"the bryant park hotel is in a magnificent, central location overlooking the park. the hotel room is spacious as is the bathroom.  and more importantly, the staff is super friendly and pleasant. shout-out to ""to"" (josephine) at the front desk. she's simply amazing."
234,thebryantparkhotel,"the bryant park hotel is my favorite place to stay in ny.  i have stayed there several times over the last year.  i was there for business this past weekend.    the rooms are comfortable and well-furnished.  the location is ideal in mid-town.  it is not the location that sets this hotel apart, it is the people who work there that make is such a special place to stay.  the entire team at the hotel is genuine, daring and kind. upon my check-in, the guest services agent, josephine, asked why i was staying with them.  when i shared the purpose of my business trip, she upgrade my room (which was lovely) to overlook the park.  even though i was in town for one night, it was so enjoyable.  i will be back again soon."
235,thebryantparkhotel,"this is definitely not forty as or 1 ranged hotel in ny. its a very good location though. pretty large room & bathroom. free coffee & puffing in the morning. minimal with good selection. servicefriendly staff. but the hotel is not very good maintained. its screaming for renovation. rooms, elevators, grm & public spaces. cold floor on bathroom & very low pressure on the water. takes minutes to wait for warm water. 1100 dollars for 3 nights are decent in ny, but i would find another hotel next time. weak 4"
236,thebryantparkhotel,"the bryant park hotel was magic. i have never stayed at such a property with such an amazing staff and i have stayed in a lot of places in new york. john and z were amazing, welcoming, attentive and had great senses of humor. plumes (besides staff), the room overlooked bryant park, the carousal, the stating risk and the ny public library. i could have spent my entire trip looking out my window. small things -- huge, warm bathrobes. a spare blanket, perfect pillows, heat that you could control (i like it cold at night thus the need for the spare blanket and warm in the day), fantastic room amenities. a huge bathtubs and separate shower. other things that i though were gone forever were  beds that are actually made crisply and pens in the room (i confess, i took them home.) no"

238,thebryantparkhotel,"i've stayed at the bryant park hotel close to ten times on different occasions so i know about this hotel way more than most guests who've reviewed here. i also stayed at many different hotels in ny in the past, including multiple big name ""five-star"" hotels. if you are one of the lucky people reading this review, please do yourself a favor and just stay at the bryant park hotel whenever you visit the city next time. this is absolutely the best hotel you are going to find in the city. the quality of service provided by the hotel staff members is unparalleled. kieran always makes sure if i need anything before my arrival. at the reception desk, shaven (who set the whole tone of this hotel for me when i first visited the hotel drenched in rain) always greet me and checks me in"

240,thelangham,this was my first time in chicago and i wanted to have an amazing experience. the langham hotel was a huge part of making that happen for me! from beginning to end i was treated like a priority. i immediately was greeted at my user by the pullman who gladly took my bags and directed me to second floor. i had an early flight and wanted to see if early check in was an option. i was able to check in hours early and my room was upgrade to a partial river view which was beautiful! since it was my first time in chicago i was recommended places to go and food to try during my stay. the expedite food credit was applied to my room and i didn't have to pay a time for my food during my stay. i even went over my limit a few dollars and it was taken care of! my room stayed cleaned and
241,thelangham,"the architectural-rich langham chicago is a top-notch business-friendly property set in a downtown sky-scraped along the river. i loved my spacious deluge premiers river view suite with armchairs, writing desk and handcrafted wooden furniture. it features neutral colors, accompanied by a soft brownish rug with the occasional violet pop and ten foot windows afforded ample skyline watching. the huge bath paved in stone features a rain shower & tub with to in the mirror and a towel warmer. the travelled restaurant serves american quinine for all dayparts & branch with a range of food fare from file minor to feroce island salmon.......i tried the salmon.....delicious. this restaurant is accompanied by travelled bar for creative cocktail connections.the pavilion is home to the"
242,thelangham,"i stayed 3 nights over the labor day weekend. the hotel is lovely and the rooms are well maintained. the food at travelled was great, i had lunch and breakfast, and the service was attentive. i recently stayed at the viceroy, which bills itself as 5 star, and all though i prefer that location, it was not in the same class as the langham. the langham is 5 star in every aspect. i hope to return soon."
243,thelangham,"i stayed at the langham chicago in march of this year as a mind starvation for myself.  on my last day there i ordered a room service breakfast that made me severely ill within about an hour.  and actually it didn’t taste right to me to begin with so i only ate a partial amount of it.  i thought initially that because i have a lumen clergy that i was accidentally glistened.  however after many doctor visits it was confirmed that i did not have lumen exposure but my tests came back confirming food poisoning- enterohemorrhagic e.coli to be exact.  i still have not completely recovered and my system was completely missed up,  yes, you read this correctly, e.coli food poisoning from a 5 star hotel.  i will never in a million years go here again and will not recommend this"
244,thelangham,"i am almost afraid to share this review, but i believe the langham is the best hotel in chicago.  stay here if you want the rare combination of a peaceful and private, luxury experience in an incredibly convenient location in the heart of chicago.  the chicago langham has helpful staff, relaxing lobby and lounge areas and a pretty restaurant.  the room was large with great bathroom, storage and space to spread out.  at the langham you can exit on either side of the lobby to the riverfront  to walk or joy without every crossing the street.  a truly great experience."
245,thelangham,"this is one of my favorite hotels in the world. the amenities and rooms are so implacable. if you can, purchase or secure lounge access via an upgrade - so many great treats and views up in the lounge.   i have just two areas of constructive criticism: sometimes the staff can be a little cold and surly. also sometimes they don’t reply to remained requests.  and the food in the restaurant and bar leaves something to be desired. i was never impressed and sometimes it was pretty bad."
246,thelangham,"the service, quality of rooms, restaurant, and all facilities are truly five stars here. i have diamond status with hilton and used to stay at the waldo chicago, but find the service at the langham to be much more warm, welcoming, and consistent. they anticipate your every need before you even think of it and understand how important service is within a luxury hotel. i love each and every staff member here and would like to give an extra thank you to channel, for responding so compassionately to a concern. this is the place to be in chicago and they’ve only gotten better after staying here for the last 9 years!"
247,thelangham,"location: 5 stars hotel lobby and room in terms of looks: 5 stars. rooms are large. however, be warned that some rooms look at a rather ugly parking structure while other rooms have beautiful city views.  cleanliness: 4 stars. my bathroom shampoo looked used! the bottle top wasn't screwed on tightly and there was soap residue on the side. there was also a cleaning wipe of some sort left on the counter. the rest of the room and hotel were clean so i still give it 4 stars.  staff: 5 stars. very friendly. door men in the day time were particularly nice.  food: 2 stars. i decided to plunge on the holiday afternoon tea which was a real disappointment in terms of food quality. it felt like food was prepared way ahead of time and a bit stale. the salad i had for lunch was beautifully"
248,thelangham,"my husband had surgery this week, and i needed a break. the room was beyond amazing. understand elegance. i’ve been to the sea many times, and the pool and fitness, did not disappoint. the restaurant was fabulous. the file and veggies were on point. the beverage selection is so extensive. the whole staff, from the people who greet you outside, from housekeeping, was great. i can’t wait until i bring my husband back for a full weekend as well. i know why this hotel is so highly rate. worth it."
249,thelangham,"i chose this property due to location and having a sea.  this hotel is amazing.  i have been to many comparable properties but based on the service and amenities, this is a 10/10.  i didn’t want to leave.  it is equal to stays that i have paid double for.  the food from travelled is fantastic and i loved the sea.  this is a must stay!"
250,thebiltmore,what an amazing experience and let me get down to it the staff was phenomena. this is what true hospitality looks like. very genuine and welcoming. everyone greet you with a big smile and you feel right at home! now following the amazing staff  the building itself is amazing. you feel like you’re in a time warp from beginning to mid with century. you truly feel the glamour of hollywood in its hay day. i’d highly suggest staying at this wonderful ironic/ historic hotel in tea
251,thebiltmore,"we stayed with dec - th jan check in was swift, room number and keys given along with directions to our room, no real welcome or information about breakfast or the bar etc more an uninterested young man. the lobby and cafe area are stunning, the door has been well maintained and really is gorgeous. it was great to see the magnificent christmas decorations that adorned the hotel inside and out and also the hotel without them. our room was ok, bathroom a little tired looking and the window wouldn't close not really an issue as it wasn't cold and outside noise level wasn't much of a problem. the room has basic amenities a hairdryer, iron and a coffee machine, replenished daily with 2 paper cups and 2 small plastic cups 4 coffee pads and 4 cachets containing 1 sweetened, 1"

253,thebiltmore,went with friends for afternoon tea and had a fantastic time. the service was excellent. while we were walking around looking at pictures we were greeted by valentine who proceeded to show us around and share a lot of wonderful history about the hotel. he was like our own personal decent. an amazing bonus to our experience.
254,thebiltmore,"considered not staying. very shabby and worn down. cracked paint, lots of deferred maintenance, not a luxury vice at all.  seemed like a good value at the time of booking but after all fees were added, wish i would have chosen another hotel."
255,thebiltmore,"had a pleasant stay at the baltimore. well maintained rooms and the staff were also polite. a lot of history associated with the place and one of the staff, mr. valentine, was kind enough to voluntarily show my friend and i around the hotel's banquet rooms and halls and explain the historic significance behind each of them. it was greatly appreciated!"
256,thebiltmore,"this review is about an exceptional baltimore employee more so than the hotel itself.  three friends and i had the privilege of being given a decent-led tour of the baltimore, by mr. valentine frank.  he was not only knowledgeable, friendly, gracious, and eloquent-he went out of his way to show us and share interesting facts and details about this extraordinary hotel.  valentine made us feel special.   he was an outstanding guide; professional and well informed about details large and small, even though he’s worked there for less than a year. thank you baltimore millennium, for providing valentine as our host.  it was both a privilege and an honor to have him.  he, and you, made our day!"
257,thebiltmore,"beautiful architecture, simple but comfortable accommodations. helpful staff, well organized parking system, well labelled areas, and fun history of the historic people and events who used this place. we so enjoyed our stay! add conditioned to shower and water bottles in the room to make the stay perfect."
258,thebiltmore,very beautiful 100 year old “grand dame” hotel. fun energy. great hollywood/movie living history. on the day of our departure i was taking pictures and i speed the manager valentine showing a ballroom to another patron. he invited me to join and we had a wonderful 30 min tour of the history and the magic of the hotel. it is so nice to be able to experience the splendor of yesteryear. thank you so much valentine! you and your staff made the trip that much more special.
259,thebiltmore,"i was attending a weekend event in the hotel, so i booked a suite for six days. i had a friend staying with me for two of the nights, so i called twice to confirm that the second room in the suite had a fold-out couch and a half bath so my friend wouldn't have to come into my room at night. (i am a married lady, and he is not my husband, so this was for both of our comfort.) i can't find my notes from my first call, but i spoke to someone (whose name i will react because the workers are on strike) the second time at 1:43 on july with. when i arrived at the hotel, it was, indeed, beautiful. i had high hopes for my suite. however, the further into the hotel you go, the more the luxury fades. the halls were dingy, and my room was a great disappointment. while some of the"

264,omnidallashotel,the hotel proved to be the perfect choice for our girl’s get away!  the makar sea was delightful and provided the escape we desired if only for a while....we didn’t want to leave.  we each enjoyed 3 sea treatments which all exceeded our expectations!    it was decided during this trip that the omne dallas would be our forever choice when staying in dallas and we will seek out other omne/sea locations when traveling to other cities!  the staff at the hotel and sea were amazing in every regard and pampered us so that we were truly saddened to end our stay!   thank you omne dallas/mokaraspa!!!!!!
265,omnidallashotel,"we were here for a convention and loved being able to stay on sight and literally never have to leave. the staff were helpful, and there was an added presence when the place was busier which made me feel safe.  our room was wonderful with incredible views.  i appreciate the “green room” feature where if a key is not inserted it dim the lights and runs the air less to save energy.  it was a bit difficult to reach the desk from our room when we had a question, but it ended up being a non issue for us.  it does have a paid parking garage.  wonderful experience for us."
266,omnidallashotel,"our recent stay at the omne was amazing! the hotel was very nice and clean. (probably one of the best hotels we’ve ever stayed) the staff was friendly. it was in the perfect spot. within minutes of everything. tons of great restaurant, museums, bars, and shopping. it’s almost like it’s own little town. the pool and pool area looked extremely nice but we didn’t get to enjoy the pool during this stay. we cannot wait for our next visit."
267,omnidallashotel,omne was great.. liked that we could walk to convention center without walking outside.   really liked the owner's box.  good food.  staff was very nice. comfortable and free belliard.   cafe hearers faith speak with salad was amazing.  not thrilled with texas spice.  service a bit slow.

271,theplaza,"this is the type of experience money can’t buy. it is worth every penny, and even more. it is an experience that is out of this world!  i have a younger brother with cutis spectrum disorder who is mostly nonverbal, and the staff went out of their way to attend to his every wants and needs, interact with him, and make him feel special. this right here is the reason why my family and i will be coming back as often as we can."
272,theplaza,"just had high tea at palm court at the place. we have had the most wonderful experience thanks to the fantastic kari all who took care of us. the tea he recommended was amazing and aromatic, the food was great and kari even gave us postcard to fill up to send to our loved ones. kari is incredible and made our first experience at the place absolutely amazing. we can't wait to come back"
273,theplaza,"i spent a few days at the place on a business trip. i have only nice things to say about the hotel: nice and spacious room, friendly staff, great breakfast, beautiful hotel overall. i was looking forward to stay at this well-known hotel and it didn’t fall short on my expectations. hoping to be back on a leisure trip."
274,theplaza,"booked the hotel for its ironic name and let's just say it didn't live up to its fame. to list a few:   1. the staff in general were not unapproachable and friendly.  most of them gave me the impression that unless i'm someone super famous/rich, it is not worth their 'warm/premium service'.  2. service response were extremely slow. i asked to take away my room dining table, and no one came for min so i ended up rolling up to the halfway myself. due to flight change, i called to see if i can extend my stay,  and no one called me back after min, so i had  to go to the lobby myself.  one night the room service told me that it would be 2 hours before the food would be delivered.  3. they charge everything, and i mean everything. i was charged for a kettle and some 'tea set?'"

277,theplaza,"grand hotel, rooms need a refresh. i arrived around pm to check in. no staff was outside so i carried my luggage up the stairs to check in. staff is gracious and friendly.  the room was spacious and the bathroom had a tub and separate shower, in a pretty white and gold mosaic tile. the bedroom door feels a bit dated and unfortunately had a musty smell that clung to my clothing when i left. between the carpet, draped, upholstered furniture…there is too much moisture clinging to everything, the room felt damp. i enjoyed my stay but would select another hotel next time."
278,theplaza,"shall was very kind and accommodation. the food was excellent and the lumen-free option were delicious. excellent place to have a business meeting. despite it being busy, we were able to have privacy."

280,omnidallashotel,this is an awesome gorgeous hotel. i came for four nights to attend the national recreation and park association national conference. it’s conveniently connected to the convention center. maybe one of the best hotels i have stayed with beautiful network displayed throughout. the staff was above and beyond! from the amazing people at the front door area coordinating the valet/opening doors to the incredible front desk staff. i loved the to in my bathroom mirror and all of my furnishing. bed was very comfortable. room was immaculate and kept clean during my stay. the views from my room were awesome especially the nighttime light show. high level of professionalism created the perfect atmosphere to attend a great conference!
281,omnidallashotel,i loved this hotel. it was well situated and easy to walk to various sites. staff was friendly and professional. many restaurant to choose from. clean and a lovely pool. the room had a great view of the city and floor to ceiling windows. i appreciated my bed made daily and garage cleaned out.
282,omnidallashotel,"horrible. i booked through apex with a promo. got to the hotel, and was told the promo wasn't on the reservation. (apex insists that's not true when i called them later.) hotel check-in agent promised she fixed the issue. hope. when i went to check out, same problem - i was over killed. the check-out agent promised her manager would fix the reservation. hope. the incorrect charges posted to my credit card a few days later. had to call back and speak with a manager who was very rude and acted like i was bothering her the whole time. in total, i spoke with four people to have a promo code issue solved. steady. horrible. will never stay here again."
283,omnidallashotel,i had a great stay at the omne. i stayed for 3 nights over the marathon weekend. check in was quick and easy. the staff were all so nice and helpful and friendly!! i had a high floor room and the views were really nice. the room itself was big and clean. they have like 6 restaurant on the property and i tried several and they were all really good!! the hotel was in close proximity to lots of great stuff and i was able to walk everywhere i needed or wanted to go. it was about a 30 minute ride from the airport. i would definitely stay here again.
284,omnidallashotel,"omne dallas is a great location to many local attractions. top notch staff. comfortable bedding, clean rooms and a variety of on site dining option make for a convince and easy stay. roof top pool area is a plus!"

286,omnidallashotel,if you're looking for someplace to waste your money this is a nice hotel that will nickel and time you for the most basic of amenities. also be carry of the toilet; as it may start spraying water out of the tank. if that happens you'll need to attach the rubber those that goes from the left valve to the center valve in the tank to stop the bathroom from being flooded.
287,omnidallashotel,"this was my first stay at the omne n dallas! it’s a fantastic hotel.. ultra modern and comfortable! check in was efficient and the personnel were friendly... i used the valet parking option as i was unfamiliar with the area and only staying one night. as a rewards client( easy to do,just sign up online!), my preferred room arrangements were watered to—i had a great view from the th floor of downtown dallas! the bed/linens were luxurious! the hot water plentiful, in room coffee maker and fridge, humorous to! what more could you ask for!! a special treat for rewards members is room service coffee, tea, or juice.. what a luxury!! also the rooms are “green efficient”! and there is an automatic night light under the bedside table that turns on when you get up!! perfect for us"
288,omnidallashotel,"this is a very nice hotel with well trained, friendly staff.  it is a huge hotel and is run very efficiently.  there are several eating option and all of the ones i tried were very good.  the rooms are nice and comfortable but it is probably time for them to change their mistresses and pillows because they are getting a little worn for such a nice hotel and operation."

291,thelangham,"the langham is an exceptional hotel, with exceptional staff. every aspect of our stay was first class from check-in to check-out a few days later. we were fortunate to have booked a room with langham club access, which is a beautiful space and is stuffed with lovely people. we also experienced the restaurant and bar which, once again, were fruitless is all respects. the door staff deserve a mention as they were all extremely courteous and helpful. well done to everyone."
292,thelangham,"our recent stay at this hotel was nothing short of exceptional, from the moment we arrived until our departure. the service we experienced was top-notch, characterized by professionalism and a keen attention to detail. each member of the staff was not only helpful but also genuinely enthusiastic, contributing significantly to the overall pleasant atmosphere.  the room we stayed in was a testament to the hotel's high standards of cleanliness and comfort. it was immaculate maintained, with every corner spotless and every amnesty in perfect working order. the door was both elegant and welcoming, creating a relaxing environment that felt like a home away from home.  room service deserves a special mention for its efficiency and quality. every request was met with prompt"
293,thelangham,"first time in why town and thanks to the langham it won't be the last. from the moment my wife and i arrived we felt like royalty.  the hospitality of the staff and attention to detail to the rooms are simply a 10 out of 10. i am well traveled inside and outside of the us and its by far the best hotel i have ever had the pleasure to stay in. the bathroom shower was simply amazing and the location was perfect being located right on the river next to the loading dock for anyone taking a river boat tour which i highly recommend if you want the best views in the city. the rite, peninsula, and penny are nice too but given the  location and included sea amenities along with the warm door this is the #1 hotel in the us and one of the best on planet earth."
294,thelangham,"we had our wedding at the langham in october 2023. i could go on for pages about the exemplary professionalism, attention to detail, kindness, flexibility, and lawlessness with which shan and emily brought our dream wedding to life. we had everything that we needed during every second of the process. our guests felt so comfortable. our vendor commented frequently on how well they were treated by the langham staff. the food was spectacular. the timeline flowed perfectly. our suite was beautiful. we felt like their only client from start to finish. my innumerable email were answered thoroughly and promptly every single time. you cannot beat this venue or these people. they are truly masters of their craft. i would trust them completely with any vision. our perfect day was"
295,thelangham,"the hotel has a great location, luxurious rooms and excellent staff, especially the customer service at the reception. we enjoyed the very comfortable bed, the nespresso machine in the room, the bar with a great view, the pool. everything is high quality. a small detail: the bathroom had a glass wall that could go opaque with the click of a button. the staff that service the room was very responsive. overall a great experience!"
296,thelangham,this has to be the nicest hotel in chicago. the staff was excellent from the get go. the check in process was very smooth and the lobby had a great fragrance to it. the views overlooking the lake and river were also fantastic. the rooms were also extremely nice and had just about everything you could need. i was able to go to the sea as well during my visit and was the best sea i have visited in the city. (even better than the peninsula)
297,thelangham,"where do i begin?  hobby and i stayed here two glorious nights as we came to chicago for our niece's wedding and most events were held at this hotel.  oh my, what a luxurious stay!  we had a wedding-block room so we got a nice discount.  we had a king bed off state st. with a distant view of the river.  this hotel is in north river and a perfect base place for walking the riverbank, taking a boat cruise, checking out various restaurant, etc.  across wabash from tramp towers.  our room was large and clean and bright and just amazing!  the bed was very come as were the linens.  the bathroom had two vanities with plenty of countertop room for our stuff.  there's a shiny gray ""what we thought was a dresser"" but turned out to the be fully stocked bar!  lots of bodies in the fridge"
298,thelangham,"5-star nice hotel.  probably just a tick below the tramp overall, but both are very nice! friendly staff, large bathroom, comfortable beds and for us, most importantly, quiet rooms. location is along the river, so good location.  we were on th floor and not a lot of view the other than of buildings."
299,thelangham,"stunning hotel with phenomena employees delivering exceptional service! my wife and i stayed here for our first time over my birthday weekend last month. she reached out to the hotel prior to the stay to coordinate transportation, room service amenities, balloons, etc; all of which were perfectly executed my the hotel during our stay. the hotel is beautiful, and extremely clean. i stay at luxury hotels everywhere i travel, and this property now ranks at the top of my list. i manage luxury hotels for a living, and was truly impressed by the langham chicago. i will certainly be back!"
300,theplaza,nick nathaniel was great. the food was not up to par for the place at all. i came 2 days before and totally different experience. ordered simple food both times and not worth the $ this dining experience. they cut corners on the sandwich and the spiders which were delicious 2 days prior were below average this time.  very disappointed.
301,theplaza,i had an appointment at the germain sea and left a beloved gold necklace my mother gave me in the robe pocket. i called the hotel one hour after i left when i realized i had left it. the hotel assured me they would look for it. i find it incredibly hard to believe they lifted a finger to help me. i would expect more from a hotel like the place. truly disappointing.
302,theplaza,"great service, comfortable rooms, mattress and pillows are amazing,  and food is delicious . staff is friendly, room service delivers fast and amenities are the best . not to mention great location close to park, museums and shopping. highly recommend"
303,theplaza,"my room service server babel chowdury was amazing. i am a bit on the sickly side and when i travel i choose hotels where i can get what i might need and babel made my morning. this is what i am talking about, being treated to the level of the expense. and treated like a human and not a credit card."
304,theplaza,the place is a beautiful hotel.  the attention and kindness of the entire  place hotel staff is excellent with special recognition for muhibul hague in the palm court restaurant today.  thank you for everything!  thoroughly enjoyed my visit and look forward to the next visit.
305,theplaza,"i arrived solo to celebrate an early birthday while holidaying in the big apple. decided to treat myself to this amazing, reputable hotel. room was splendid, with floor, loved the finishing and style, huge shower and tub and hot water! exemplary service from each and every person i spoke with or who assisted. 5 star all around there for kindness.  i'll admit the meals are way overpriced for what you get. at least stand out if you're going to offer same food other restaurant have and charge triple for them... like a lobster roll with french fires... came out warm instead of hot, fires were mediocre. then a caesar salad was $65 delivered to my room. they charge $10 just for delivery then you feel obliged to give a tip... for a salad, without meat, and guns that were hard and"
306,theplaza,"i highly recommend the place, not only because of its history and luxury, but for the quality of people they have in their work team, the waters hussar, air and andrew at the bar were so warm and nice!  i came for my birthday alone and they had a present for me 😍! everything was perfect. stay at the place! ✨👌🏼"
307,theplaza,"thank you, russe - front desk manager, for your amazing hospitality and accommodations. the staff here makes you feel like 1 in a million and the rooms are breathtakingly gorgeous. the place is a place i hold very dear to my heart and everytime i stay there, it’s like home away from home. absolutely wonderful!"

309,theplaza,"i had a great visit. the service was great. the room was amazing. the people were very nice. i can't wait to go there again. this was my second visit to the hotel and it was just as good and even better than the first. like i said, another visit will be on the way in the future!"
310,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,we came to dallas for an overnight date. we have stayed here several times. when we got in late at night our room was uncomfortable hot. when fatal got involved he took care of everything. he changed our room to a cooper one and arranged for us to go back for our belongings  in the original room the next day. his customer service was excellent. very grateful. slept well.
311,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,my husband and i really enjoyed the grand welcome 🤗 and superb customer service from abel at the reception desk. we had several questions of which he gave comprehensive answers to. our check in process was easy and haste free. he thanked us for our military service and choosing the magnolia. abel made us feel appreciated. we consider this hotel an absolute gem and are happy to always book our stay with you. thank you so much abel for starting off our texas vacation with a giant smile 😊…
312,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,amazing hotel huge rooms and great service  the views were outstanding the breakfast shop downstairs s was simply relish the location is central to everything there is an amazing food court across the street at the at&t center and then on the other side there are tons of restaurant in theaters. this is the best place to stay in downtown dallas in my humble opinion
313,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,magnolia hotel blotched our reservation. we couldn’t check in until after pm. the room we were given was unacceptable. we were only given one towel for two guests. front desk never fulfilled our towel request. the air conditioning in the room did not work. when we talked to the go about the issues during check out we were told we were going to get a refund. never happened. called and was told that the go remembers checking us out but does not recall authorizing a refund. overall worst experience. worst customer service. stay far away from this place not worth the money!
314,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"the good: the hotel is located in the heart of downtown dallas within steps to restaurant, few attractions, and bars. rooms are clean but outdated. the hotel has no parking on site, however, it has a convenient valet parking. parking is $40/day and service is fast.   the bad: no restaurant on site except for a little coffee shop by the lobby with limited items and seating. however, there are various restaurant within walking distance. no us port and no safe in room. view to the city is blocked by dirty windows.   the hotel is located in the heart of dallas so, if you don’t want to hear cars reviving their engines all night get a higher room. the hotel has about 28 floors so expect some delays with the elevator traffic.   the ugly: if you like great customer service, this is"
315,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"we stayed for 2 nights at this hotel. i should’ve paid closer attention to the check in time because up is super late, and they didn’t allow for early check in. we ended up having to get ready for an event in the lobby bathroom that had no soap or toilet paper. we told the front desk on 3 separate occasions throughout the day and it never ended up getting fixed which really confused me as i saw hotel employees use the same bathroom constantly. when we finally got into our room, we had 1 towel, no wash cloths or hand towels. the next morning my wife noticed our bed sheets had blood all over them, so awful. we immediately addressed this and the towels with the front desk and they said they would get them changed out and put more towels in our room, this was at a. we leave for"
316,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"hotel is past it's best. in dire need of refurbishment. restaurant & bar permanently closed. the room was spacious but not well cleaned. the toilet wasn't fixed properly. we had housekeeping but they left us just 1 hand towel, 1 robe and one facecloth for 2 people. poor value for money. would not recommend."
317,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"my partner and i came here for a wedding. the pictures online looked good and the top few reviews were good but i should’ve kept strolling. we arrived and wasn’t informed check-in was at pm. that’s fine, we paid the $56 to check in early. we get to our room, there’s 1 set of towels when we clearing said a couple was staying here. the smoke detector was dangling from the ceiling. i informed staff and they acted like it wasn’t a big deal. we asked about the pool and reception told us because there’s no wheelchair access they had to shut the pool down. i feel like that was important to tell the customer or cut is some slack on the bill. the rooms are drab and kind and there’s no staff to be found in case of anything. the pictures definitely don’t match the hotel. never again"
318,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"the hotel was amazing, and the customer service was immaculate. broke was working the front desk and shout-out to her, she was sweet and accommodation. honestly it was the best experience i’ve ever had at a hotel."
319,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"we’ve stayed at the magnolia a few times, and it has really gone downhill. it has always been a nice but one of the more economical option if you want to stay right in downtown. this time, my husband and i stayed two nights while in town visiting some friends and family. we were upgrade to a suite when we arrived, which was nice and included a full kitchen, but the to in our room didn’t have a power cord, so we called reception. they said that someone would be right up, but no one ever came, so my husband finally went downstairs. the person working there couldn’t figure out how to rectify the situation, so the solution was to change rooms. so we had to pack up all our stuff at midnight and move rooms. we were also only provided with one full size towel, which was odd."
320,theadolphus,the adolphus hotel is a prime example of dallas classic luxury and the staff and atmosphere is always amazing. at check-in we were grace with jena who really made the check-in process so smooth. my girlfriend has never stayed her and jena made sure that her experience was special. her kindness will be remembered.
321,theadolphus,"great service from the front desk to the pullman, sergey in particular. while there some issues, everyone was gracious and accommodated us, making it a memorable evening. we also enjoyed the tea experience in the french room, terrific staff!"
322,theadolphus,"i stayed at the adolphus hotel during the dallas holiday parade. it was extremely busy, as it seemed like almost all the parade participants were staying there - not including innumerable parade watches, those enjoying the holidays, wedding and etc. i was nervous of the service i would receive. now!!!! was i pleasantly surprised😁 the valet guy was amazing! very kind and hard working. the front desk manager germain was extraordinary!!!! he quickly got us checked in, was very calm and patient with me. he expedient answered my questions. he showed prestige customer service skill, that represented what i expected from the adolphus. i must say he exceeded my expectations. the entire staff was simply unforgettable. staying at the hotel doing the parade, will surely become a"
323,theadolphus,"from the minute we stepped foot in this hotel, we were greeted with nothing but hospitality and friendliness.  grant at the front desk gave me a history of the hotel at checkout. i was very grateful for this because i would have missed the beautiful historic pieces they have on display. the staff was very helpful with recommendations to eat or visit. the rooms were very spacious and clean. the alliance is like no other hotel i've stayed at. i would definitely stay here next time i'm in dallas."
324,theadolphus,"most recent of several stays over the years. adolphus never disappoints. beautiful historic hotel, well maintained. staff always excellent - very professional but warm and engaging. jena and grant took good care of us at check in and got us off to a great start to our stay. cheers to them and all the staff at the bars and city hall gastro."
325,theadolphus,"the adolphus never lets us down. excellent all the way around from the moment you pull up and hand your keys to the valet. room was great, room service was perfect, and the staff went above and beyond to make our trip perfect!  can not give this hotel enough stars!"
326,theadolphus,"this is a lovely place to stay and the lobby smells divine!!  customer service is five star, especially the bellhops and the door holders and the valets.  shoutout to jay!!  and to alexandre!!  thank you so much."
327,theadolphus,my family stayed here over the christmas holidays and our experience genuinely exceeded our expectations. aren and jena at the front desk were truly delightful to work with. they patiently listed to all my odd requests and then worked carelessly to meet our needs making us feel like royalty throughout our stay. i plan to go back to the adolphus as soon as i can and would recommend this property with no hesitation!
328,theadolphus,when we were leaving jay was a huge help! he helped us get our bags into the user and was very kind. all of the adolphus employees were great to us. i recommend for anyone to stay here great experience!!
329,theadolphus,"the staff working at the adolphus is the best of the best. when i first became engaged over thanksgiving weekend, i immediately sent email to multiple avenues, hoping to quickly schedule hours and start the planning process. unlike other avenues who didn’t respond for a week or more, blaine ends responded within 48 hours. from day one, she impressed me. she always made me feel like a priority even though she had many other events to handle. during our first tour, it was the weekend of the christmas parade and the adolphus had 5 wedding that weekend. even with those competing priorities, she dedicated time to my mother, fiance, and i for our tour. the tour itself left no question in my mind that this was my venue. she showed us around the hotel, knowledgably explaining it’s"

331,theplaza,stunning hotel and the most amazing customer service. we stayed for one night in december 2023 and left very early which meant my daughter left her teddy behind. we only realised when we arrived back in the up. the staff went above and beyond to find this bear which she has had more over 10 years. they remained me some photo of all the places the bear had been and failed him back to her. amazing..

336,theplaza,"to say our stay was lackluster would be a polite way to say it. everything was a complete disappointment, from the lack of good and knowledgeable staff to an nearing attitude. let me just start at the beginning. upon check in i asked if there was an at in the hotel and we were told yes there was, but it was located in the sea which was closed. since i was going to the sea in the morning, i was content to wait. upon my arrival in the sea, no at. an encounter with a pullman in the elevator confirmed there was no at in the hotel. that same morning my fiance went to the front desk to request a newspaper and was told there were not any and they must be requested in advance. understandable so he did just that for the following morning. the next morning we leave for a quick walk to"

340,homewoodsuites,"second time staying here…will stay here again.  had some minor issues with the room and each time the front desk and maintenance personnel responded promptly to fix the issue.  my last night, we got some hot chocolate from the front desk area - and i was looking for some ice to cool down the piping hot drink.  oliver t. went out of his way to get me a cup of ice and visited with us for several minutes.  he asked where we were w from and asked if we needed anything…didn’t have to, but did and made us feel welcome."

373,hotelriuplaza,"i felt that every part of my stay was great. i felt that you displayed a great staff, all of which were very pleasant. you also provided a great breakfast, and i very pleased with the option that were provided. its refreshing to be able to say this but this truly was an all around a great stay! thank you all for being amazing!"
374,hotelriuplaza,"i found this hotel to be far too loud.  they do not use carpet in the always, but rather porcelain times.  the sound ounces around the corridors.  the room was cut and nice.   staff was just ok.  but due to loud noise late at night, for me the place failed on very basic requirement of providing a good nights sleep.  won't return."
375,hotelriuplaza,terrible hotel rude employees and a dirty room stay else where. the manager of reservation to the head director that is a nasty racism female. please stay elsewhere especially if your black they will not treat you correct here pp please go elsewhere.
376,hotelriuplaza,my check in experience was amazing.  i arrived at 10 and my room was not ready.  i was told i would get an email when it was.  i went to two meetings and came back at 12:15.  at 12:25 nice saw me sitting in the lobby and came over to tell me my room was ready.  she had sent the email at 12:22 and then saw me sitting there.  she came over in case i did not check my email all the time.  i was very impressed.
377,hotelriuplaza,we were graciously greeted at the front desk by john j. he was more than helpful and accommodation with our requests. we appreciate his help and will definitely be staying at the rid times square in the future!
378,hotelriuplaza,"awful hotel for big travelers. hordes of tourist and helpful staff. elevators are a nightmare and room keys constantly fail. rooms average. left something in the room, which was found and then lost by the hotel and they made mo effort to help. avoid at all costs."
379,hotelriuplaza,"there are big pro and big sons to this hotel. main con - the room was so noisy. i felt i am sleeping on the th avenue, the window was ineffective in noise reduction. noise from the corridor were also disturbing. i believe most of the rooms suffer from this problem. then check in process was a nightmare. i arrived at am. waited all the line just to learn that check in starts at pm and they charge $50 for early check in. this is cry. i understand that you will be charged if you want to pre book an early check in, but when you arrive - if there is no room, it's one thing, but if there is room - why not give the room for free? a week earlier at the west i got a room at am(and it was a very quiet room)! then when i told the receptions the next day that i had a horrible"
380,virginhotels,"great downtown location, nice room set, i loved the door separation between the bedroom and the entrance area where was a make desk, the wash area, also the toilet and the shower was separate too which i really liked"
381,virginhotels,"great hotel with excellent all around service.  really liked the size and layout of the grand chamber king suite.  both miss rocky's restaurant and the rise rooftop lounge were very good as well.  also, a really nice location, with several things within walking distance."
382,virginhotels,great stay! had at the front desk was wonderful. we stayed in the suite and it was beautiful. i love the vesna chair. the bed is gigantic. easy access to the train. excited to try other virgin properties. double sinks too! great views. we’ll be back
383,virginhotels,"i'm a frequent traveler and love staying at the virgin when i come to chicago. the team there is excellent, the rooms are spacious and well appointed. the coffee shop and inside restaurant are both excellent. all around great accommodations, fantastic service and location!"
384,virginhotels,best hotel.  huge clean well designed room.  great location.  great staff.  i have stayed at other hotels in chicago nothing comes close!  i cannot say it enough - huge room with a vanity plus a desk.  large windows.   hardihood floors.  cannot be beat.
385,virginhotels,enjoyed my stay here in june. the location is central and convenient i really enjoyed the rooftop bar too. the room was clean and come room and the staff was friendly. couldn't ask for much more on a business trip stay.
386,virginhotels,"settled away from the rustle and bustle of the city - but yet, close to everything, virgin  hotel is a great boutique hotel that oozes vice.  from the moment you walk in, to the hip upper level, to the classic elevators  and quand rooms, this hotel has so much going for it.  damned did a great job in helping me check in, and was very helpful in answer questions about the hotel as well as surrounding area.  small attached cafe is a great place to grab a quick bite as well"
387,virginhotels,"the staff was very welcoming and helpful. the room was nice, spacious and clean.  the hotel is also very dog friendly - they even let us bring our dogs on the rooftop! i will definitely stay at the virgin hotel chicago again."
388,virginhotels,"i booked as a virgin atlantic gold member, and fan of the virgin brand, thinking they would deliver an exceptional experience. it turned out to be fine, but not something special. the pillows were really thick so i didn't sleep well until i found a flatter one in the cupboard. there was a bottle of champagne in my room, which was nice, but no-one could explain why (front desk seemed surprised when i asked them). so i took it, but maybe it was a mistake - later in the week, a gift got put in my room that was clearly for someone else (i returned it to the front desk). one evening i came back and was told i needed to move rooms, because of some plunging issue. they said it was ok to stay one more night, but then the next day (when i had only one day left) they insisted it was"
389,virginhotels,"kind staff, clean rooms, wonderful location! we were there during the canadian wildfires and hotel staff was extremely helpful in getting mass for us while we were outside. great hotel that really helps guest make the most of their time in chicago!"
390,thelangham,"update to september 2020 review:  the langham remains a top choice when visiting chicago!  the rooms are well-maintained and the housekeeping team does a tremendous job upholding the brand. the front office could do a better job acknowledging return guests — the check-in experience certainly falls flat.   i return to the city multiple times a year and was very much looking forward to the re-opening of the club.   this rating and review is based on the club experience which was once, in my opinion, the best in the country. as always, the club converge are welcoming, friendly and accommodation — always remembering guests’ names and references.  the food quality however has really declined. it is no longer an elevated, curate experience. instead, the food is more on par with a"
391,thelangham,"the langham chicago is the best of the best. on a long weekend to celebrate a birthday, i decided to stay at the waldo astoria, langham and peninsula to get a take on chicago’s five-star hotels. i travel to chicago three times a year and almost always stay at the langham. that will not be changing!   while each hotel has an unique quality, the other two simply could not compete with the refined elegance, luxury and service at the langham. the staff are accommodation and welcoming and will go the extra mile to ensure a lawless experience.   the hotel has taken safety precautions very seriously while also maintaining their level of service and amenities that their guests have come to expect. while all travelers anticipate a reduced experience in some form, the langham has"
392,thelangham,"i stayed at the langham chicago for the second time in january 2020 and i can honestly say it was truly spectacular!! they clearly set the benchmark for the luxury hotel market in chicago and they have gorgeous rooms, amazing food, top tier lawless service and a wonderful walk to everything location. i actually love how the hotel is tucked away on wabash removed from a busy street and has a rather discrete entrance.   this is easily one of the top 5 hotels in the us. it really is a spectacular hotel!   everyone at reception was lovely- warm, friendly and welcoming, thank you thomas for the extended checkout time (: the door/bell team were amazing! never once do you open a door! these guns were super lovely and always said hello, asked if i needed transportation and were"
393,thelangham,"this hotel offers unpretentious luxury.  my recent visit was exceptional because of the beautifully appointed spacious room (deluge premier), implacable service, and lovely sea.  the location is very convenient to shopping and dining.  highly recommend!"
394,thelangham,"from arriving at the front door to leaving this was a 5* experience.    from walking in through the door to arriving at check in they greeted me by name. how lovely!   i arrived early - the room was ready. thank you.  john the converge arranged a tour for me with a sick process.  a lovely guy who worked hard to build a support.   it was raining - elliott the footman sorted an umbrella.  a gentleman.   the room was stunning - everything, every little detail was sorted.  the tin of colonies were great!   i could go on but the people made it - the cherry on top was the room. thank you.   expensive but complete value for money."
395,thelangham,stayed here for a couple of nights last week. i had some business near o'hare and decided to stay in downtown for the weekend. would have chosen the peninsula but decided to try the langham since i've never stayed at any of their properties. overall the hotel was fantastic. the footmen are helpful and willing to help you with the luggage. i arrived a little past noon and i acknowledged that i was a bit early and its ok if i can wait but the front desk lady (sorry i forgot her name) was able to check me in early.she was helpful and like any five star hotel staff took her time to explain all the amenities and services esp me being a first time on their property. other 5 star property staff would walk with you all the way to your room but at least she walked with me to the
396,thelangham,"from the moment i walked thou the door every langham employee made a true effort to make sure my every need was cared for. my personal favorite was the wife card which was in the key envelope. it is a step by step guide to how to get onto the hotel internet in your room!  i am not teach navvy and this is the first time ever i have been able to navigable this in a hotel without having to call the front desk. the room was spectacular, fabulous bath with deep soaking tub, make-up area and excellent accent lighting which kept the entire visit restful. wonderful sea with steam & anna providing a wide variety of treatments. the fitness, pool and hot tub are located on the th floor.  i strongly recommend grand's chocolate cake from the in room private dining... i will be back!"
397,thelangham,"this is my and time staying at the langham chicago and both times i booked the club level king suite with view. i've also stayed at the langham ny which is also just as fabulous! absolutely loved my stay all 3 times in chicago and ny. chicago- rooms are modern with enough room (beds are perfect!) with floor to ceiling windows.  bathroom is beautiful and luxurious (bathtubs enclosed with the fabulous shower) and the views of the river were great! everyone there is incredibly friendly and go out of their way to make your stay memorable. they have a lovely sea, fitness,  and indoor pool that my son enjoyed when we were there the first time. the club lounge is great... breakfast is fantastic and the evening happy hour is wonderful too. my son enjoyed grafting snacks and drinks"
398,thelangham,"stayed here for a very short one night stay.   staff were extremely friendly and helpful upon my arrival. the club lounge is a delight (similar to the design of the london flagship property), and the breakfast spread was very good and of very high quality. one special mention is that they stock loss water (both sparkling and still) which is a very nice touch in my opinion. the evening/happy hour offerings were less cellar but definitely adequate.    the room itself is very spacious and well appointed, and the bed was simply amazing - had one of the best sleep in recent weeks.   the location of the hotel is convenient for those who wish to visit attractions (eg. the bean) within walking distance, something that i also value.   all in all a most delightful stay and will"
399,thelangham,"if you are driving, do not use gas to get here. call them and they will direct you in. this will save a tremendous amount of frustration. the langham is perhaps one of the finest hotels i have ever been to in my life. it has earned and deserves its number one spot as the best hotel in chicago. i am incredibly harsh when judging hotels and there is literally not a single thing i have to say they could do better. the location is right next to tramp tower and incredibly convenient. the rooms and the workmanship is expert. fully modern with the most appealing designs and furnishing. and service! simply unbelievable service. my congratulations to the management team of the langham for delivering an exceptional stay experience."
400,thebryantparkhotel,"rarely i give a review before my trip ends, and i am back home, but the staff at bah and the service make me do this the and day of my trip. dominion greeted me at the hotel, and john at the front desk and one after the other, the superstars make you feel like you belong. this was my first trip to ny and will surely be a memorable thanks to the hospitality, location, and energy of bah!   can't wait to be back."
401,thebryantparkhotel,"excellent customer service from john @ the front desk. i attended a private in june of 20232 and left my suite jacket there. for a long list of bad excuses, i didn't get return to the hotel until last week. despite my ridiculous story, john checked lost & found and my blazed was still there. thank you john."
402,thebryantparkhotel,"first time traveling alone i was super nervous. i was greeted at the door by roman very welcoming he assisted me with my luggage and kindly walk me to the front desk. to, julie , cannon and verona were friendly super exceptional!!! i love how lit this hotel it has a bar downstairs gives a nice speakers vice . the rooms are super nice they also come with housekeeping soft comfortable beds very very clean bathroom.  i loved the converge team john and wight they know the city so well so many recommendations i ended up going to st which had a live do will definitely come back to new york city and stay at this hotel super convenient location wise across the street from bryant park. there also a whole foods walking distance, i loved the whole star ny experience !!!"

406,thebryantparkhotel,"fabulous historic hotel overlooking bryant park.  upon arriving, i was immediately greeted by the liveliest hotel staff member, to. i immediately knew why all of the reviews of this property are so good, it's because it's a special hotel, in a magical location with staff truly committed to making your entire experience as good as possible.  i was upgrade to a room that features three large windows looking out over the carousal in bryant park.  the room was clean, comfortable and even had a large soak tub.  although my room faced with st., it was remarkably quiet.  this hotel is in the best location in milton manhattan. close to everything including th ave. says, times square, koreatown and so much more.  i highly recommend giving them a try."
407,thebryantparkhotel,"picked this hotel because it was highly rate on trip adviser. well, it exceeded every great review i read. let's start with the most important thing any establishment must have when one is traveling-the staff. everyone i came in contact with starting with check in went out of their way to make my stay the best possible. john, wight, verona, red, roman-and the go siobhan-made me feel at home at all times. they all knew my name by the first night. the hotel opened in 2000 and is in a historic 21 story skyscraper built in the 20's. the renovation done to convert it to a hotel are amazing. my room was much larger than what one expects in new york. it was spotless, well appointed and had everything i needed during my 7 night stay. the bathroom was stunning with beautiful marble"
408,thebryantparkhotel,room with a view overlooking bryant park was wonderful. the bed and pillows very comfortable.  the robe was my one favorite part of the hotel extra. the staff members were so welcoming and helpful with every interaction!!
409,thebryantparkhotel,"this is the second time i have stayed at this little gem in one year. if you are looking for a clean, generally located hotel, this is it. the staff that i met-  scott, john and red- were welcoming and helpful.  generally located to attractions and transportation.  what more could you ask for?"
410,thebiltmore,"i was able to sleep very well and treated with amazing respect , can’t wait to go back and stay there again , i believe anybody would love this location if your looking to have a decent event as we looking the ballroom and open area it makes you feel like your at a began hotel"
411,thebiltmore,we had paid in advance and planned a tour of the hotel.  the tour company stood us up.  the hotel was in a quand.  frank valentine volunteered to give me and my 3 friends a tour.  he was very knowledgeable about the history of the hotel and the various events over the last 100 years.  he saved the day for us and gave us a great experience!
412,thebiltmore,"first this place is a museum within itself, the beauty in design and comfortability is to behold. mr. valentine, one of the phenomena people to serve us was and is exceptional.  i will tell friends."
413,thebiltmore,"this hotel is beautiful and old, and although it has its quires there’s so much history there. the room was spacious enough for the two of us and the location is great. i would definitely stay here again."
414,thebiltmore,"i was feeling bad about some personal issues, and then i ran into mr valentine! brightened my whole outlook. he went out of his way to make sure i was ok. best stay ever. i will be bringing my family here soon."
415,thebiltmore,"this is my second visit to la however this trip was longer and we stayed at the  baltimore hotel for seven days. the staff at converge were cheerful, helpful and made myself and my best friend laugh everyday. valentine took particular attention in making sure we were safe by suggesting to travel by user. helpful advise were given and places of interest for us to visit. what was nice was the warm welcome we would receive when in the lobby. we always looked forward to being greeted by him. my mother was also very grateful that valentine made sure we were alright and looking out for our welfare even though she wasn’t even on this trip. great stories and images of famous individuals were shared and most importantly he asked about our day and if we had any further plans for the day!"
416,thebiltmore,we stayed for a week and had a lovely time. the rooms were very comfortable and the staff was great. the food is ok. thank you to albert in the parking area for helping so much to get us in and out of a tight spot.
417,thebiltmore,"we stayed to attend the labyrinth masquerade and, as always, the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful. check out on sunday is always busy, but the bell and valet staff are incredible. valentine helped us today and was so kind and just genuinely lovely. we will definitely look for him when we visit again."
418,thebiltmore,"this is such a historic and beautiful hotel. elegant relaxing rooms. outstanding senate public rooms. the staff was friendly and helpful including valentine who provided  very helpful history about the hotel. many of the guests were from other countries and lots of foreign languages were heard. we loved this -it was as if we had traveled to a foreign capital. lots to see and do nearby (main library across the street, retro station a block away to go to hollywood universal studies santa monica la live pasadena or long ch, grand central market 3 blocks away, museums up grand avenue, scale restaurant along th and grand including a whole foods at eighth). downtown  la while historic and interesting is still a work in progress. so, be mindful which direction you walk from the"
419,thebiltmore,i stayed at the baltimore with my friends and loved the experience. the hotel is beautiful and the service was great! a special staff member named valentine made the stay immaculate! he was very well spoken and professional. showed me around the hotel and gave me further information about the long standing of this hotel and also recommended great places to visit on my stay! very happy with his service and the staff at baltimore.  will definitely visit again. 10/10. thank you baltimore and valentine for your incredible service :)
420,theplaza,"i stayed four nights in june. the (minor) con's first: no kettle for a late night or morning tea or coffee and no newspapers. if you want a grew, bring a tea bag and the hotel will give you a kettle. i'm only saying that because ny is brutally expensive for everything! whatever your spending budget, be prepared to spend way more! and don't expect a view of th or central park; all these keys have been converted to apartments. the (many) pro's: rooms are spacious and really well appointed. excellent linen, super come beds and the staff are absolutely superb. looking for luxury? this is where to find it. lobby bar is amazing, excellent choice menu and cocktail. for me the best in ny so not to miss!"
421,theplaza,excellent people and customer service. great location. very comfortable. special shout out to babel c. great staff member who went above and beyond. older experience but worth it for the history and was a fun time.
422,theplaza,it was early morning and bumped into this guy in the corridor.  his name was babel!  it was very refreshing and his warm energy - reminds me why i chose this hotel. friendly and passionate staff - it’s these sorts of people that make the difference.
423,theplaza,"we were a school group visiting and tea at the palm court is one of our favorites. city was wonderful with the pre-arrangements, and shall was fantastic on the day. great food and tea, with outstanding service. also very accommodation for miners with galleries or special requests. the students and chaperones all had a great time. we come here every time we’re in new york city as it is truly is a special experience. highly recommended!"
424,theplaza,our experience at the palace was personalized and memorable. far went above and beyond in his intensiveness in detail and care. thank you so much for making us feel special and giving us the place experience.
425,theplaza,"thank you, far, for making our high tea experience so wonderful.  he brought us different pots of tea to try with different colored cups.   the food was fine. i’ve had better sandwiched and stones at other tears but the service and atmosphere was wonderful.   closer restrooms would be nice too."
426,theplaza,"we had the most special afternoon, posted by far. the high tea was perfect, the service exquisite. i had been with family 6 years ago to celebrate my daughter’s 10 th birthday. far made it the most memorable occasion. he was as thrilled as i was to remember the special event. when we come to celebrate next, we know who we will request as our host. thank you, far for making each event one for the memory books ❤️"
427,theplaza,our time at the place was absolutely amazing thanks to far. he was so delightful and friendly and made our experience magical. we reminisced on the last time we were there and had a picture with him and took another today. memories cherished.
428,theplaza,"the stay was great, they upgrade me to a bigger room but the hotel somehow mysteriously charged me 57.71usd more for ""refreshment center"" consumption which i have absolutely no idea what it is, don't even know where the ""refreshment center"" is!!"
429,theplaza,"on a recent trip to ny i had the pleasure of staying at the place and entertaining in the champagne bar. our server nick nathaniel was out of this world!  i’ve been staying at the hotel for over 20 years and have to say it was the best service i have ever experienced at the hotel. nick made me and our guests feel so welcome in a warm and welcoming way that was just the right amount of humor, warmth and daring making sure we had a magical experience. thank you to nick and the place champagne bar team. you are all out of this world!!!  can’t wait to come back and see you all."
430,omnidallashotel,"cut, fun, stay for a birthday weekend with my friend! clean facility. lots of food option and restaurant in the hotel and around the area ( we enjoyed texas spice for branch). i also liked the refused water in the pool and lobby. the pool was fun and the employees are so sweet! emilie the pool bartender was such a sweetheart - rely great service!    only thing i would change is that i wish the room had more outlets and also housekeeping didn’t clean our room the first night. however overall it was a good experience :)"
431,omnidallashotel,"even though i paid 80$ to have late check out, the housekeeping nonstop knocks on your door an hour before your late checkout, then every 20 minutes come back, and we called down to get an extra hour (which the desk said yes) they refused to leave and had some manager person come up and i had to tell them we called down, yet i still could here them standing outside my door 10 minutes later. i pulled back the sheets of the mattress to help house cleaning anyway, and saw two huge urine stains on the mattress.  there’s this weird ass lighting thing here too where you have to put your keyboard in some slot in order to get power to anything so if i needed to use the bathroom at night i had to trip over everything in order to find my keyboard, then find the slot, then find the light"
432,omnidallashotel,"i highly recommend staying at the dallas omne hotel! i spent my sweet 16 here with my friends and family and it was absolutely amazing. incredible service, amazing amenities, and stunning views! i couldn’t of asked for a better room and sweet surprise of a beautiful cake and balloons when i first walked in to my room! the pool temperature was perfect and the hot tub was amazing! the pool view from night was spectacular and being able to see all of the downtown dallas lights was just breathtaking, even the omne hotel lights were incredible! i definitely 10/10 recommend!!"
433,omnidallashotel,"i have never stayed in a place this nice before, i was a treat from my friends and i absolutely loved it.  i had a lovely view of the nearby tall buildings and the room was a nice size, the service here is really good whether you are getting a quick coffee or having a dinner.  breakfast is pretty decent and it’s just a really nice place to hang out downstairs.  the pool area is lovely too.  it’s a huge hotel and is in the perfect location if you want to explore.  the valet at the time was something like $15 and was super easy and quick."
434,omnidallashotel,"so, for $300 on a weeknight you can check in at 4:00. pool closes at 10 pm and opens at 7 am. when i went to enjoy the pool at 8 am they were power washing the surface. said excuse me ma’am were going to power wash right here next to you! i called and asked for a manager over and over. never got one to answer the phone. i was raised in the hotel business and i would fire these louse managers. would i recommend spending $300-500 on this sack? no.  lights broken in the bathroom just like hotel 6 which costs like $50. stay elsewhere….."
435,omnidallashotel,"horrible experience. internet didn’t work for any of our 5 devices. the to connect to the internet. so no to or streaming all weekend. front desk sent us to a constantly ringing phone for help. for $230+/night it’s pathetic.   seriously, look elsewhere if you want a painless experience. staff is helpless. internet is a basic and standard offering for any hotel regardless of the star rating."
436,omnidallashotel,i highly recommend the omne hotel in dallas.  not only is the location amazing but the staff went above and beyond to make our trip enjoyable.  special thanks to stephen bartenstein!!!  he truly made our trip.
437,omnidallashotel,suite was nice but the front desk person said they didn’t like any. that’s a red flag. nice spacious suite but that’s not the vice we on. we stand for freedom of thought and visions. get people that get it
438,omnidallashotel,"pro: central location, bob’s speak and hothouse, modern, copy rooms, excellent valet service   sons: breakfast at the restaurant is terribly bland and forgettable. joe the manager is rude and frankly reminds me of a tea or my employee based on the one interaction i had. further, he deluded that his arrogance toward me when i needed a new key was because i was with a group that was “loud” the prior night. i told him that i wasn’t part of that late night event but his behavior was terrible. he had name badge and no business cards. i’m an omne select guest member and this will be the last time i stay at an omne. they need to met theirs employees more thoroughly and get rid of the ones that have antagonistic personalities. hospitable is the antithesis of hospitality management."
439,omnidallashotel,"i really enjoyed my stay. the aesthetic are beautiful. the location is right in the midst of downtown. its modern, the service was great and so much to do on-site. great for romantic trips or a nice gateway. i'm not crazy about having to pay for self-parking. you mine as well either pay for valet or take an user. overall it was amazing. i will be returning. oh and the to in the bathroom mirror was a nice touch too! ll"
440,omnidallashotel,the rooms were great but i didn’t like the fact that i was greatly inconvenience when 2 elevators were taken out for lip guests and i had to wait 20 minutes to get down from with floor. the only way i got down was because the lip guests were kind enough to allow me to ride down with them. otherwise my wait time would’ve been longer than 20 minutes. not cool.
441,omnidallashotel,vices were good and the sports bar was had great food. drinks were taste. felt comfortable and relaxed in the room. the  view was beautiful and my night was breathe taking. i couldn't have asked for a better time and i would go again for sure.
442,omnidallashotel,very much enjoyed my trip.  i went just to visit dallas for the weekend and wanted to be easily accessible to downtown and the bishop arts district. this property provided me with both as well as quality service.
443,omnidallashotel,"i spent my birthday in my beautiful city, dallas. i always ""do it big"" for my birthday but this year i choose a night at the omne, because well, it's the omne; also because of the central location. i enjoyed the hot tub, fitness center and org bob's speak & chop house, and all by myself! it was amazing! plan on doing this every birthday i spend in dallas."
444,omnidallashotel,overall the stay was great. the less than perfect overall comes from the cleanliness of the room. the nightstand had a plug behind it and also dirt and dust from a year of not cleaning behind it. it covered my cord and hand everytime i needed to charge my phone. the tub was not clean either as and there was hair and dried up blood on the pillow and sheet (luckily they give you plenty of extra pillows so i just threw that one to the side). beds were comfortable and view was great. a bit noisy at times in the hall though but it's a hotel...that can be expected.  you will need your key card for electricity which is annoying but necessary for the environment. i understand. valet was great though my power sneering belt broke over night while my car was valet marked...... ah... drove
445,omnidallashotel,"i was pleased with everything as expected and had a great night sleep. the staff was great my room was amazing and the bed was so comfortable, not to mention my view was gorgeous. i will always recommend the omne"
446,omnidallashotel,"there is nothing small time about this hotel, maybe because it's in texas and everything is bigger in texas!  starting with the for, it's impressive and really big, with various seating areas, bar and country live music, this is texas y'all!  the check-in process is quick and easy, the staff friendly as this is dallas and people are friendly. as the for is pretty massive, if you have too much luggage and bags to deal with, get a porter to deliver them to your room as elevators and floor always are a tree due to the sheer deformity of the hotel.  the rooms are really nice, super clean and spacious! i was only there for one evening as i was stopping over on my way to nashville  from austin but would happily stay there again. it's in a good location, close to downtown sights"
447,omnidallashotel,i stayed at the omne dallas. great hotel in a nice area. guest services went above and beyond to meet my request. i would recommend this hotel. i definitely will be staying their any time in the dallas area.
448,omnidallashotel,"husband booked a special ""mon break"" for our anniversary with a sea package and overnight stay, for me, sans kiss.  sea was great as well as i received the best facial i've probably ever had.  after the sea, i checked into my room.  the room was clean, nice and comfortable.  all was well until about an hour and a half in, the traffic noise from outside is becoming more and more obvious.  then, the emergency vehicle noise begin!  the traffic noise then gets quieter when i hear the doors slamming from neighboring rooms.  annoying, but then comes the outside traffic and vehicle noise.  i am not expecting to get the ""peaceful"" night my husband paid a lot for, so am planning on checking out soon.  tonight.  overall, the hotel alliance is nice but if you can't relax and you want a"
449,omnidallashotel,"the omne is in the middle of it all. good staff and reasonable breakfast service, the rooms feel a bit soulless, although they are functional and modern. big views of downtown, although much of the view is the convention center."
450,thelangham,not much of an upgrade. was proudly told we had an upgrade through booking with american express. was so excited and shown to a room on th floor which is the lowest floor for rooms regardless of category.  view was ok but nothing special so was actually really disappointed rather than delighted. would rather they hadn’t even mentioned an upgrade. if i hadn’t got this room with what we paid for then i would have been disappointed.
451,thelangham,we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the langham. great location and views. our room was spacious and the transparent shower wall was a cool feature. the pool was large and the sea is calming. highly recommend a massage from massage therapist koko. she’s exceptional.
452,thelangham,"absolute top-drawer from the valet and bell service to check-in and housekeeping.   obviously this is a plunge stay for 99% of people and worth every penny. the art, architecture, location and design is among the top places i've ever stayed. my wife has had more ultra-lure travel than i have, and she said it was her best hotel experience she's ever had. the only thing that comes close would be found in asia or the middle east.   the club floor is an absolute must. the food and service up top is implacable and the views are amazing! it's like a 5-star all-inclusive in downtown chicago. we met a couple of great travellers that set up in front of the best view and basically didn't move. why would you want to leave?  the pool and sea are wonderful. the room layout is now my"
453,thelangham,"my husband and i toured every single luxury hotel venue to host our wedding at in chicago and there was no doubt in our mind that we were going with the langham once we met with shan rash (director of social watering). shan and his team went above and beyond in ways that you only dream of as a couple costing a wedding of 230 people.  from the level of service, to the quality of the food, to the environment and attention to detail, we could not have asked for better. all of our guests had their expectations exceeded with their stay at the langham."
454,thelangham,"a wonderful 3 nights at the langham. we managed to grab a special offer for a room on the club floor. the room was come, the bed delightful, and in-room nespresso was nice. the club room was a great spot to pick up a quick bite, snack, or beverage.   the personnel were all very friendly and helpful. location was great for us. show’s crab shock and rum steakhouse were both fabulous but not expensive. walk to riverboat tour, many arteries, shopping."
455,thelangham,"we've stayed at some really nice hotels and were so blown away by the langham.  this hotel is pure luxury.    from the moment we arrived we were treated like royalty.  i had remained ahead asking if a room with a river view would be possible - our room was perfect with a wonderful view of the river.  the location of the hotel is perfect.  we were able to explore chicago without having to rent a car - everything was very valuable.   we were in a room that afforded us use of the lounge everyday - and i must say, it was well worth the price.  we had breakfast at the lounge everyday and loved the afternoon and late night snacks.  my only criticism of the lounge was that it was advertised as being open until 9:00 p.m. -but one night when we showed up at 8:30 they were already putting"
456,thelangham,"the location, amenities, and staff were wonderful. the executive club level lounge is the way to go to truly experience all the property has to offer. the grm and sea were fabulous. our converge, david was exceptionally knowledgeable in his recommendations for dining option, museums, jazz bars, etc.. truly a superb 5 star property on the chicago river."
457,thelangham,"my wife and i were in chicago to celebrate her birthday and we stayed at both the waldo astoria and the langham. both stays were amazing; however, the langham stood out. waldo has a classical take on luxury: crown holding ceilings; carpeted floors; and white marble bathroom. the langham is more contemporary with hardihood floors; floor-to-ceiling windows; and an earthen tone modern bathroom (including an amazing rainfall shower).  obviously this is simply a matter of personal preference; but we preferred the look and feel of the langham.    what stood out the most for us was the level of service at the langham. guest relations manager hanna khemani communicated directly with us before and during our stay to ensure everything was perfect.  she remained my wife before our stay"
458,thelangham,"i recently had my wedding at the langham, chicago.  if i had to plan my wedding all over again, i would choose to work with the langham every time. the service is implacable. they make you feel like royalty, and your guests will have about your wedding for a long time afterwards. two special mentions are required: first, shan rash - the director of social watering - he is responsible for the highly personalized feel that you get at langham. he remembers every small detail (for example, he met my grand once and found out she likes moscato so he had a bottle delivered to her room for wedding day). he will also help you plan and execute the event of your dreams. second, nation the chef and the entire urinary experience. this is not your average wedding food. it's high quality,"
459,thelangham,i would actually give this hotel 10 stars! everything was absolutely perfect! the entire staff team were so friendly and kind. the room was spacious - view was awesome.  room service was terrific and the bar rocked - amazing drinks and snacks!  we truly enjoyed every moment while we stayed here. location is convenient to everything. treat yourself - you will not be disappointed.
460,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,i spoke to numerous staff throughout my stay and all of them were very friendly and helpful. they were responsive and never seemed too busy to answer my questions. room was great and comfortable plus plenty of space to set my computer. i will definitely use heart again.
461,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"stayed for company sales meeting. all areas were clean and bright. food service throughout the even was pretty good. food and service were great for a 1,500 person event. my room was clean overall. the windows overlooking the highway made were permanently streaked. on the with floor, the highway noise wasn't too bad. the leather(-is) headboards of both beds were scratched and marred from use over time. one member of our company was robbed when he walked off property after dark."
462,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"hotel room was excellent but i was in a room on the th floor in an area called the trim. it is directly over the bar and due to the shape of the hotel it's like an echo chamber. i was there during a large business conference and it was truly like having a concert arena outside of my door. apparently they know this is an issue. each room is stuck with ear plugs, but it was unacceptable to have noise that loud until almost 12:30 am. front desk staff basically said there was nothing they could do about it. the bar closes at midnight and when i called after that they said the bar was just trying to get rid of people. at that point. a hotel is supposed to be restful. it was anything but that in the evening. the comfort of the rooms however, is on questionable. the room, size and"
463,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,heart staff gave a warm welcome and were helpful with special needs. the hotel is clean and beautiful.  i appreciated their speedy check in and out process. they had plenty of conference rooms. the hotel room was spacious with great views of downtown dallas.
464,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,outdoor staff and lobby staff super helpful this trip and i really needed it. booking was simple and straightforward. very clean room and corridors as well as all the meeting areas. the dinner banquet on night #2 was fearlessly served to a very large group.
465,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,this hotel is a key part of  dallas skyline and the staff does a wonderful job of keeping this old beauty in shape!   i stayed on the th floor with a city view and it did not disappoint.  the staff from the valet to the restaurant was kind and attentive.  love staying at this hotel for our annual conference!
466,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"excellent amenities and friendly, professional staff.  every aspect was clean, efficient and of high quality.   the glass elevators present intriguing sights when using them. much enjoyed. . the friendly desk staff were very information on local events and locations."
467,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"check in was excellent. wait staff in restaurant were slightly above average. bar staff, which was full but not overwhelmed, was very poor. told “last call” (at 10:45 pm) had been called - as we watched the bartender pass us at least three times and ignored us, only to see as we walked out after paying, a server ask her table for last call. not good."
468,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"everything met expectations.  i loved the furniture in the room - chaise lounge by window and leather decline.  there are other less expensive option that are convenient in downtown, but the quality of the heart rooms is definitely more scale. keep in mind the train goes by right outside."
469,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"the overall experience of this hotel was excellent!!! rooms were cleaned daily, courteous staff, the breakfast with the buffets was amazing! everyone was very helpful and pleasant. i have absolutely no complaints."
470,thebiltmore,"fantastic experience. we all know la has an abundance of beautiful hotels with top notch amenities and the baltimore is one of them. however, what sets this hotel above the rest is their hospitality. their people and how they make you feel will keep you coming back. memories and feelings. thank you to all the amazing staff!"
471,thebiltmore,"love everything about this hotel. first visit, will not be last.  it is most definitely a most. downtown la very convenient  hotel staff and hospitality was very professional and friendly. couldn't have asked for a better stay. thank you!!!"
472,thebiltmore,"the baltimore is a stunning hotel and we were not disappointed by its beauty everywhere you turn. however, i did not like our room which was on the street side and extremely noisy. the window appeared to be the original window from when the hotel was originally built, which i'm sure is supposed to be charming, but instead it let in every single sound from the street and also cold air. i stuffed towels into it to try to muffled the noise without much success. it would not be safe it you had children with you since the window lock did not even work and anyone could easily fall out. if i had had children with me, i would have requested a room change for sure. the bathroom door did not close (we had to brace it closed with a pillow for any privacy), and it also needs dating. we had"
473,thebiltmore,"the baltimore is nothing short of amazing. i recently visited the hotel with my parents and reminisced their wedding 25 years ago. valentine the manager was kind enough to give us access to the ballroom where my parents were married to share the joyful experience with me. he was incredibly respectful, professional, and beyond kind. valentine’s hospitality made me feel welcomed and made the experience incredible. i recommend this hotel to anybody looking to stay in los angeles!"
474,thebiltmore,"my family came to visit and relive the memories of their wedding day! the staff is incredibly kind and helpful. the manager, valentine, took time out of his day to show us around the hotel and gave us an amazing history as well. he is a lovely person and we all enjoyed our conversation with him. if you are considering staying here while visiting la, the baltimore is a must. it is the most gorgeous hotel in a great location!"
475,thebiltmore,"hair, elizabeth, and valentine were/are amazing. wish all hotel experiences were as pleasant to deal with as these 3 made it. all 3 of them were kind, courteous, and above and beyond helpful with all our needs upon check in and assisted with getting us situated for our stay"
476,thebiltmore,"my wife and i are visiting los angeles from denver and we walked by the baltimore yesterday ( saturday feb. 11, 2024) and decided to stop in to admire the architecture and atmosphere within the interior of the world famous baltimore-la.   the alliance and beauty was stunning and the staff was exceptional! so much so, we decided to partake in high tea which was thoroughly enjoyable.   additional, we enjoyed our experience at the baltimore so much on saturday that we decided to return on sunday to continue our exploration of the public areas of the hotel. a very nice man at the front desk asked if we  needed any assistance and i indicated that we were simply admiring the pageantry of the grand hotel. he offered to have one of the staff give us access to view some of the ballroom"
477,thebiltmore,"beautiful classic hotel.  great staff. amenities not what you would find at top line hotel: in lack of nice in house restaurant serving dinner.  the bar was ok and the bar food was fine but that’s my only complaint. but i knew this going in, so it was a trade off for the baltimore experience."
478,thebiltmore,"first of all, every employee was very kind and understanding. they take the time for you. we had a couple of questions during check out, valentine and albert helped us out and were very nice!  from booking to checking out was smooth sailing!  every day we came back to the hotel with a clean room and made up bed! the aesthetic of the hotel was so nice and pretty."
479,thebiltmore,"it was a great experience, the hotel is classic, beautiful and copy at the same time.  all employees were very kind and gentle, specially alexander and valentine whom gave me great tips and a fun conversation.  i definitely recommend the visit to this hotel."
480,omnidallashotel,"this was a record low for omne customer service.  so many things went wrong and no attempts were made for service recovery.  we did express check-in, yet still had to wait in line to check-in again. we did not receive our loyalty member complimentary drink coupon on check-in and we were told ‘just walk back and get them’.  when we asked if there was really only electrical plug at the bedside, we were direct to use the alarm clock us.  well, there was no alarm clock.  we did not opt out of the daily cleaning of the room.  we asked three times to have the room cleaned and were told ‘you often out’.  if they had told us that the first time we asked, we could have cleared that up and not waited until 5 pm to get it done.    so - my recommendation would be to stay somewhere else."
481,omnidallashotel,"hotel looks great and is in a relatively clean part of downtown. good speak restaurant, but not many food option in walking distance. rooms are decent size and clean but hotel is showing its age. good sports bar too."
482,omnidallashotel,"excellent stay, great customer service. this was my first time in dallas, it was a great choice for hotel accommodations. the moment we check in and check out it was incredible. i will definitely cost again."
483,omnidallashotel,"we stayed at the omne hotel mid may and it was amazing.  the lobby, hotel rooms and grounds were beautiful.  both oscar at the front desk and addison in the restaurant treated us like royalty and made our stay here extra comfortable.  thank you oscar and addison!"
484,omnidallashotel,"nice, well maintained hotel with several restaurant located on the property.  errare's and the biergarten had delicious food.   location is also a huge plus since there are many restaurant, parts, and other activities within walking distance."
485,omnidallashotel,excellent hotel with great views of the city. staff is extremely welcoming and friendly. my family loved the infinity pool and hot tub. great view of the city. restaurant in the hotel were all very good. one of the hotel restaurant was closed due to the holiday.
486,omnidallashotel,"this was the worst choice for our christmas break. the hotel is both dirty and unbecoming. our deluge room was not as good as the one we stayed in at laquinta. mold in the shower, mold in the bathroom sink and events full of thick dirt. the restaurant served fried food which was grossly over prices and lacked appeal. two nights wasted. after the rite carlton the omne is a 2 stars hotel 😝😝"
487,omnidallashotel,"amazing from the super friendly staff to the best pillows i have ever laid my head on! this was my first time, but definitely not last,  to stay here and everything was great. we got into town early and where given our room early,  did i mention how awesome the front desk lady was?! we are here for a concert and some christmas shopping so the location is very convenient. had a meal at the owner's box( pretty good casual dining). lots of choice for eating. great beds, view.... the trip was for my daughters day and the front desk staff sent her up cake and a card they all signed....how sweet was that! will definitely be back and recommend."
488,omnidallashotel,"great marathon hotel!  perfect place for dallas marathon stay.  very close to start and finish; come beds; fast early; staff all watering marathon shirts and helpful.  we use it to stage family marathon viewing as it is central, good valet, great  place to hang out and wait for runners, lots of good food and different choice."
489,omnidallashotel,"we decided to treat ourselves to a starvation for two nights at this beautiful hotel - we thoroughly enjoyed the hotel, the restaurant and being walking distance from fun things to do in the west end."
490,sheratongrand,best service! claude is the best she takes care of you to make sure your stay is perfect. any service needs you may need she takes care everything to make sure your stay is superior! thanks claude!
491,sheratongrand,"a tea favorite. great location, big, clean rooms, with lots of power and surfaces. ran into an issue the first night (with a party in the next room). security was on it and finally shut it down. the next morning they moved me to a different room to make sure it didn't happen again on my second night. the guest service gentleman that brought me my new keys was kind, professional and helpful.  in my new room, the shower leaned all over the bathroom, but claude (fantastic housekeeper on with floor!) was right outside my room and quickly, kindly cleaned it up and replaced all the wet towels with new ones. she told me to reach out if i needed anything else. a real professional, she clearly takes a lot of pride in her work, and it shows. bravo, claude!"
492,sheratongrand,"this downtown property is consistent with what i think of when i state at a sheraton brand of merritt hotel.    the lobby is nicely arranged with lots of places to work and interact. the front desk staff greeted me quickly and was very helpful.    the rooms are a generous size and decorated with an updated woods theme in the main area and a disco-deck style mirror in the bathroom.    the bed was very comfortable with excellent quality linens and pillow choice, which is very important to me.    the bathroom amenities were full sized, which i really appreciate to cut down on plastic waste and that you aren’t limited to tiny sized amounts of product. unfortunately, all three of the shower bottles were empty or nearly empty.    i would give the hotel 4.5 stars because it’s good,"
493,sheratongrand,"i was very satisfied with the sheraton grand and would go back again.   all the staff were very helpful.  room was very clean and comfortable.    if you are a light sleeper, i suggest asking for a room at the th street end of the hotel because a bar on th street plays live music until 2 am.   i had breakfast at their district restaurant every day."
494,sheratongrand,"i had the pleasure of interesting with matthew santo recently, and i must say, his customer service skill are absolutely outstanding. from the moment i approached him with my questions, he demonstrated a high level of professionalism, attentiveness, and education to ensuring my complete satisfaction.  one of the standout qualities about matthew is his exceptional communication skill. he listened carefully to my concerns, taking the time to understand my needs and address them appropriately. his responses were clear, concise, and always timely, which made the entire customer service experience smooth and efficient.  beyond his impressive communication, matthew displayed an immense amount of knowledge and expertise in his field. he confidently answered all of my inquiries,"
495,sheratongrand,"the staff was helpful, attentive and kind. location is great. property is very clean and the downstairs restaurant is soon cool with great bartenders.   my absolutely favorite part of my trip w as glands in housekeeping. she works the rd floor and is the sweetest and most kind person you’ll ever meet. my room was always meticulously completed and she was nothing short of amazing. honestly. i highly recommend it!"
496,sheratongrand,i had a good stay here. the converge was very helpful getting me taxi’s to get around. i appreciate that. it was close to everything i needed. was able to walk around ok. just need to keep alert. can be a little settling at times. room was nice and quiet.
497,sheratongrand,beautiful rooms and wonderful view at the club lounge. minute the attendant there was sweet and very welcoming. the other guy working there was fantastic too. i’m glad they were both there. great job.
498,sheratongrand,"i had a great stay here. definitely recommended property.   1. the location is superb - walking distance to every interesting tourist spots, as well dining places. if you need to shop, there’s may’s as well unique store. if you need to take a retro, the th st station just below. walgreens just across the street if you need some supplies.   2. tea in general has a worst reputation of homeless people and crime rates. however i feel safe staying in this hotel. i don’t see any homeless people around the property. very safe and convenient. a few blocks away, it’s another story.   3. service is awesome. thank you bread for answering all my queried via convoy chat pp, land from the reception also superb. although i only stayed for two nights, my room is being cleaned up without"
499,sheratongrand,"wonderful hotel! front desk team was lovely! room was spacious, and i got upgrade to a room with a ratio. it was super convenient to check the weather in the morning ☺️ location is great with many restaurant and bars nearby!  the rd floor fire pit dining terrace is lovely. the ac and wife were great!"
500,omnidallashotel,"this is a busy, vagrant location on the outskirts of downtown dallas next to the convention center. it has many floors, a pool, a great fitness center, and several different restaurant in the building and in the small annex across the street. i really enjoyed my stay here overall; it was comfortable and convenient for both the convention and for going to downtown locations (15 minute walk to most). while it seemed to be very modern, there were a few small stitches: the room's master lighting control affects the thermostat, the bathroom mirror to didn't work, and the elevator weight sensory are really sensitive (a person in a power wheelchair had to ride alone and we all had to get off). overall, this is a fine property for conventions and full service, but it could use a little"
501,omnidallashotel,"yes, for real. times are good and too often, mainstream bands who claim to be in this strata i feel - are basically just a courtyard with larger lobby with services dumped down.  not here.  omne dallas is a true, luxury business hotel. does that mean four seasons - no - and they don't claim that but this location easily puts many marriotts and resting to shame in my never to be so humble opinion. i just returned today....and for you, my dear reader, i thought to pen my thoughts while they are still fresh but bottom line, scale, thoughtful, comfortable. at the end i will write a few minor suggestions but not to complain - rather, out of respect that this hotel aims to expel.  entrance ************ very clearly marked. plenty of room for cars to pull up, load, unload.   lobby"
502,omnidallashotel,"very disappointed because: - room service did not always renewed the bathroom items (champion etc.) - to was not fixed despite my request to the receptions  - missing electric sockets - room is a bit dark, lamps are not enough  - the lamp near bed was too high , difficult to reach the switch button from bed - fellows are way too soft - bathroom is a bit old should be refreshed  - taxi fees to airport was a trepoff the reception does not seem to care nor warn guests about the real price"
503,omnidallashotel,"checking and cleaning staff were quite good, garage entry/exit booth not stuffed all the time and no one ever answered the help button. food and service lacked at bob's chop house and hope & hen, good at black ship and room service."
504,omnidallashotel,beautiful hotel. great downtown location. but 2 big issues. filling issues for second year in a row. our hotel stay was compel by our company. we were asked to provide a credit card for  incidental only. we did so. we ended up being charged the entire 4 night stay on our card. it was a major haste to get that removed. second issue was we had no ice on our floor for 3 of the 4 days stay. we had ice the first day only the ice machine was broken wed through sat and still broken where left. major inconvenience and not what you expect from a high end hotel.
505,omnidallashotel,"i was warmly greeted at check-in and advised my room was not ready due to a large turnover in the hotel.  the staff worked quickly to get my room ready, allowing me to get checked in and get to work. the meeting facilities, where i was speaking, were clean and attractive although a bit small for the number of attended. the food provided during the event was usually appealing and taste. would definitely consider this hotel again when in the dallas area."
506,omnidallashotel,"i stayed here for a conference. i had a room on the with floor facing reunion tower. the room was quiet, clean, and spacious. the room has a minifridge, and you can request a microwave. i had a maintenance issue one night, and they came to do the repair within 5 minutes of when i called. i requested a late checkout on my last day, and the front desk gave an extra hour, which was nice.   the only reason i am not rating the hotel a 5 is because of the lack of responsiveness when i had questions about my hotel bill after my stay."
507,omnidallashotel,"i stayed at the omne downtown dallas for 4 nights while attending a conference in the hotel and convention center. clean rooms, comfortable beds, and decent food choice around the hotel, though the area isn’t all that valuable if you want to leave the omne grounds. the vs imbedded in the bathroom mirrors are a bit of a useless gimmick, but overall, a good hotel."
508,omnidallashotel,"the staff was super nice and helpful and the lobby was nice and clean. the coffee shop was a great touch. my room was not so nice. mind fridge  was old and rusty. furniture had whipped wood. the bathroom was very run down. rust on the mirror, tub was shipping and the light switch was old and dingy. the room needs a major update. very run down. but clean."
509,omnidallashotel,"stayed here earlier this week for business. housekeeping did not tidy of the room the first day. the second day i checked out early but within a few hours, i realized i left my portable speaker in the room (valued at $200). because my room card was canceled, i called the front desk, spoke with lost and found, returned to the front desk later that day, and was told that they would track it down. but of course, no one had seen it. i returned and called repeatedly over the next 2 days--by this time, i was dismissed outright. i hope whoever ended up taking it home is enjoying it. nice room, too bad it cost me an extra $200 to stay there."
510,silversmithhotel,"the staff are really what make this hotel. they're incredibly warm, friendly, and eager to help. i especially want to shout out every, who worked the mornings. she was one of the nicest people i've met and made me smile with every greeting."
511,silversmithhotel,"the hotel was located near shopping, restaurant  and local attractions in walking distance. the door service and valet were amazing! unique was extremely helpful during my stay. he took the time to help me several times, and this made my stay great! above and beyond service from him!another staff member, plan, at the front desk was also very attentive and made sure my stay was great and that my room was up to par. the room was clean, spacious, and overall very comfortable. i would recommend if you are staying in chicago."
512,silversmithhotel,fabulous hotel for my business conference!  accommodations were gorgeous and the rooms were very spacious. exceptional staff took care of all of the guests on a very  busy weekend!  unique and the lady bartender were top notch!  would totally stay there again!
513,silversmithhotel,"stayed at the silversmith hotel downtown chicago. hotel, service and employees are amazing. unique the footman was incredible. recommend this hotel to everyone. will definitely stay there again when back in chicago"
514,silversmithhotel,"great hotel, lovely atmosphere, pretty door. beds are very comfortable! special shout-out to the employees for their excellent customer service, most especially unique, valet, who was helpful, fun, and most importantly, became a friend in a city i did not know! lots of awesome food and drink places nearby. tiniest of complaints is just that i was left without caffeinated coffee one morning, which surprised me, but they had coffee downstairs and fixed the in-room coffee debate the next day. thank you, i will be back!"
515,silversmithhotel,"exemplary service all around. the front desk is welcoming and not only answered our questions but are accommodation to all of our needs and extending our stay.   our valet attendant, unique, was so friendly and attentive to our car needs. it made it so easy to stay overnight with our car. thank you for your excellent service and attention to detail."
516,silversmithhotel,"unique, our pullman, was fantastic.  greater us with a smile throughout the day, always there when we needed any assistance.  he made our trip absolutely perfect.  we will come back to silversmith hotel again."
517,silversmithhotel,"i stay at the silversmith every year; i have for the last decade. i attend a yearly conference at a nearby hotel, and i always choose to come to the silversmith instead. it’s a bit more toned down, with a much friendliest atmosphere without shipping on amenities or the “feel” of a downtown loop hotel. there is no staff like the silversmith staff. they have helped me through booking and filling issues over the years, whether on the phone or in person. unique will happily greet you at the door and help you store your bags  (he has for the last 13 years), and people like victor and every will treat you like family with lots of love and a little stark. the rooms are great- always clean, the floors are quiet, the bar has great drinks (try the petty!), and they will always help"
518,silversmithhotel,stayed at the silver smith for several nights for a work trip. location was great with in walking distance to bars and restaurant. rooms were clean and comfortable. huge shout out to unique who was incredibly helpful throughout the duration of our trip.
519,silversmithhotel,"i loved the moulton brown bath products. the bed was comfortable and service was great. unique at the front door was so nice, generous and professional. i would highly recommend this hotel to other people."
520,virginhotels,"i stayed with a friend, for a weekend in chicago.  the location is great. we were able to walk or use the train for everything.  the staff was very friendly, always asking if we needed anything.  the room was quiet and very clean.  we spent an hour at the rooftop bar. wish we could have spent more time there, as it seemed really fun.  we would stay here again.  deane kept our bags after we checked out, and headed to lunch. he was so friendly and efficient."
521,virginhotels,"rooms were very clean and nicely set up. location of the hotel was great and the rooftop bar served great cocktail. staff was very nice and helpful.  we extended our stay for one additional night, which was no problem at all."
522,virginhotels,"great hotel located in a very cool part of the city! the rooms were luxurious, clean, and comfortable - and a very good value given the amenities provided and the location of the hotel. we will definitely return!"
523,virginhotels,"great location, possibly the most comfortable bed i’ve ever slept in at a hotel, friendly staff, good coffee shop (surprisingly excellent english tea!), fun if very busy and noisy rooftop bar. highly recommend."
524,virginhotels,"i stayed here six months ago and loved it. so on my return trip to chicago, i booked again without a second thought.   sadly, it was a mistake.   first the positive: great staff. friendly and kind. they even left me a delicious welcome treat in the room. i truly appreciate it.   everything else is good too: come and well laid out rooms, quiet enough, and a convenient location.   however: the wife is completely unable. it drops out for hours at a time. and there’s nothing the hotel can do. it’s just that bad.   last time i came on a leisure trip and didn’t notice the terrible internet. unfortunately this time i needed to work it and was not possible.   i’m so disappointed. it’s a lovely hotel in a great location. but in 2023, no wife is a dealbreaker :("
525,virginhotels,the hotel has many amenities and the rooms are very copy. i loved the rooftop and the fitness room is great. it’s close and within walking distance of many things. so i’m extremely happy about my experience and everything i got to enjoy as well as experience.
526,virginhotels,"third night or a four night stay.  the minimal wasn't restored, the room was not made up, the walls are paper thin, the rooftop bar serves terrible drinks.  the worst thing is that the staff is completely apathetic. if you ask for something they just look at you with a vacant expression.  it's too expensive for being this cheap. also i hate the rose/flower smelling soap and lotion.  i've learned a lesson never go off brand."
527,virginhotels,amazing service. went for branch this afternoon and had stole as our server. everything was delivered on time in a friendly manner along with great food. i would highly recommend coming here for food and a great experience
528,virginhotels,"now. what a disappointment. there were no chairs in the lobby while waiting for friends. a man was shot outside of the hotel and ran into the lobby. he later died. while waiting outside of the hotel door for an user, a homeless woman attacked my friend. the area isn’t safe. the hotel rooftop bar is popular and loud, and one of our rooms was noisy. it took awhile for security because they had to secure a weapon. need i say more."
529,virginhotels,"i'm so happy we stumbled on miss rocky's.  although there was a slight wait (no reservation), once seated my group had an amazing brush.  our bread was boasted to perfection, our eggs her seasoned and fluffy and our coffee was hot and strong.  our server, else, whose bubble personality made our experience even better made sure our experience was exceptional.  i'll definitely come back during my next trip to chicago!"
530,thebiltmore,"great experience at the baltimore. loved the theme of the hotel. being a historic hotel with age, it has a vantage feel mixed with hints of more updated modern charm. price was great too with all the amenities that were included such as the fitness center, anna, and indoor pool. loved the details such as the framed pictures of moves both old and new throughout all of the halls."
531,thebiltmore,"from the very beginning everyone has been so helpful. a desk attendant leaned me his personal charge. room, bathroom  is  beautiful. the large with century windows with view really enhance the experience. i can’t wait to experience all they have to offer! just got here."
532,thebiltmore,i loved the architecture and history of the hotel. staff was so friendly and professional. my room was copy and the bed incredibly comfortable! i ate in the bar and enjoyed the baltimore burgher- it was perfectly made and delicious! this was the perfect respite after a busy day at the fitexpo at the convention center.
533,thebiltmore,"positive: an atmosphere hotel, historic albeit slightly fading around the edges. provided me with foam pillows when i asked for them. (big) minus: i booked online through ""gosplitty"" (hotel trader) and paid an element for ""room rate"" and a (substantial) element for ""fees and taxes"" up front. it was explicit in the booking process that the price i was being charged was ""all included"". but. when it came time to check out i was asked to pay another $330 in fees (characterised as ""destination fees""). the duty manager told me that ""gosplitty"" was ""nothing to do with us"" (!!!) and that i should just pay the $330 and get it back from them. i'll never stay at a millennium hotel again."
534,thebiltmore,"first, the positive. the bell staff, front door staff and security attendants on the ground floor level were friendly and helpful. the housekeeping staff made my room exquisitely. however, the negative. the bar staff was inattentive. i sat waiting to be served or even acknowledged for several minutes as the bartender was more focused on a conversation with another patron. it wasn’t until a bar back asked me if i needed anything that i received any service. the next morning i went to have breakfast in the ground floor restaurant, thinking that the layout would be similar to the photo on the site. it was not. no problem, i would order from the menu. i made my request, and it was served correctly and quickly. however, they removed all the settings on my table when they realized"
535,thebiltmore,"i love the baltimore, have stayed several times .  they are the episode of grace and beauty, they are celebrating their 100th anniversary.  once the home of the scars way before they were called that it has an incredible history and beauty seldom seen today (don’t miss the pool). it’s my in-town escape and one of my favorite hotels in the world. always clean comfortable rooms and the staff goes above and beyond to make your stay easy and comfortable.  it is located downtown, an easy walk to any of the popular tourist or sports destination.  it’s also across the street from the subways that can easily get you to hollywood, santa monica, pasadena  and even long beach."
536,thebiltmore,stayed last night in amazing la historic … millennium baltimore with the most amazing history and current photo of cerebritis beginning with 1923 grand opening. and more lobby design glad than you could imagine! best staff i have found world wide! highly recommend!!!
537,thebiltmore,"beautiful hotel, spectacular lobby and area by the water fountain. the indoor pool was amazing! loved how it maintained it's old roman bath style. rooms were comfortable. enjoyed proximity to things."
538,thebiltmore,"maybe i missed something but this hotel markets itself as being luxurious but i didn't see it. i also was not greeted once during my stay. maybe it's because i'm a solo female traveler who doesn't fit the look of what their establishment wants to cater to but my card didn't decline and i would have ignored the smaller things i had problems with and maybe even extended my stay since the location is great. however, as my mother says, customer service is everything.  there are some pro: location is great. housekeeping everyday was awesome. the housekeeping staff were quite nice too! the ac was fantastic and almost got too cold which isn't a bad thing.   other than staff, the hotel is old and it's nice that it's kept its old look and been in moves. however the carpet in my room"
539,thebiltmore,"the hotel is amazingly gorgeous and i love all the history behind it. that being said, most of the amenities are average, no better than a holiday inn. very friendly staff and is probably the saving grace of the location.  my room looked like the carpet hadn't received a proper deep cleaning in years, same with the furniture save the bed. the mattress, like everything else, was simply ""ok"", but not what one would expect from a high end historical hotel. it would be nice if they offered some form of transportation to/from lax.  the main bar is fun with a great staff and well made drinks. cost is on par with that style of bar, no complaints. however, the rendezvous cafe left much to be desired. service was so-so. the food was a huge disappointment, simple eggs, potatoes, sausage"
540,hiltonuniversalcity,"victor made a delicious cocktail and was super welcoming. recommend grafting a solid drink and a nice chat!  other staff was awesome and charming, nice seating and good vices. and unique creative drinks."
541,hiltonuniversalcity,victor made me a fantastic toi whiskey cocktail. super lovely service and very funny. great hospitality. my family often stays at this hotel when they visit so it’s a pleasure to come by and enjoy some drinks at the hotel (good drinks are hard to come by at big hotels like this).
542,hiltonuniversalcity,"i was recently emergency evacuated from my home during the recent captain fires. i just bought my home and i was terrified to say the least. after grafting what i could and fleeing, i drove around for a little while wondering what i should do.... i was stressed and shaken to say the least.   i knew i wouldn't sleep, so i wanted somewhere close to my work, in a place that was familiar, so i drove to my old neighborhood (touch lake) which is right next to the universal hotel line. the address made me choose it... 555 universal.   555 is an angel number that means there is a coming disturbance in your life... but you can trust the universe.   this may sound ""full"" to some people, but i took it as a sign that i was in the right place & that i could trust that i'd be looked after"
543,hiltonuniversalcity,"my server, nicholas b. went above and beyond to make sure that i had a wonderful stay during my resort pass pool visit. this was my first experience using resort pass and i’m glad that i choose hilton at universal. the absence had an beat lively feel to it and the family culture made it feel like home. thank you guns! i’ll be back soon."
544,hiltonuniversalcity,"the hotel is dated. the room has dirty, whipped furniture. the wall near the air conditioned is stained black. two drawers and the fridge were open when i got to my room. the fan sounds like a used car. the tub needs revealing. the soap dish is stained. the glass table is filthy. the lobby and bar area are straight up early was. and the front desk couldn’t figure out how to change my reservation, made through hilton, to 2 nights instead of 3."
545,hiltonuniversalcity,i have to say staying at the hilton universal hotel is the best experience! the hotel is always super clean! they are always disinfecting the hotel! i always look forward to the amazing view and the friendly staff!
546,hiltonuniversalcity,"in october i stayed at this hotel  hilton at universal citywalk very clean, very friendly employees,, great customer service the view is amazing and the rooms are spectacular it is my favorite a place to stay other than being at my home i give a 5 out 5 stars overall. special thanks to the staff at hilton universal staff you guns rock."
547,hiltonuniversalcity,"i stayed here last week — this is a very nice hotel, clean, spacious rooms & lovely large bathroom with excellent shower. i was greeted pleasantly & felt safe & welcome.  because universal studies park is closed (could), the hotel had a very deserted feeling.  the gift shop is only open on weekend. there was a footman on duty, but nobody offered assistance with bags, etc.  i’m sure their standing is less due to could.  also, i wish there were more food option in the evening— the one restaurant is high-end, full meals; it would have been nice to be able to get large salad or lighter option. breakfast was delicious, with really great waitstaff. overall, a nice stay, i’d like to return when everything is open 100%."
548,hiltonuniversalcity,"the best hilton i’ve ever been  all of the staff were very friendly and helpful  great location.the room is very big and clean.the bed is very comfortable,i liked your mattress cover  also amazing bathroom  the only one thing that i didn’t like is that the furniture is a bit old but hotel is perfect!"
549,hiltonuniversalcity,"this was my first ever trip to the states of america, so i was a little nervous. i came to hilton with my grand who wasn’t quite feeling herself, so she ended up flying back home to the up.   the staff at hilton are on a whole new level with customer service from the valet workers to the house keeping swell as the converge desk and front and bell. they were very polite and any issue that i had they fixed for me pretty much sap. i would really really recommend anyone to stay here, it’s child friendly, not far at all from universal studies.  i will definitely be coming here again one time in the future as this is by far the best experience i have had.   i want to thank all the staff at hilton for making the difference to my stay.   it’s well worth it guns, check it out!"
550,silversmithhotel,we enjoyed our stay. we especially enjoyed unique's help navigation chicago. he gave great suggestions for food and transit; always there to help us out each morning! super thankful for his suggestion on getting us to ripley field with no traffic!
551,silversmithhotel,"when i first got to my room, i was immediately put off and alarmed because a dirty old rag had fallen off the handle on the inside when i opened the door. when i went to pick it up, i realized it wasn’t a hotel towel but rather someone’s used towel left behind. i was extremely unnerved because what if they had just given me the wrong key to a room that was already taken or what if that was some weird mark for housekeeping to show there’s just a single female in the room? i then stepped in to find they gave me the wrong room with only a single bed when i paid extra to get a room with two beds. so i went downstairs to get this fixed only to find out that apparently all of their rooms with two beds were filled for the night and the girl at the front desk was very nonchalantly and"
552,silversmithhotel,"unique was amazing! he suggested restaurant to go to and would point us in the direction we needed to head. he was bubble all the time and always felt like a friend. the staff behind the counter were also amazing. they always greeted us when we came through. when they cleaned our room, the second day, they gave us bottle water right away because they knew we always asked for some when we got back from our day of adventure. i really was impressed on the customer service! we also had an open window that wouldn't close, and they sent maintenance right away to fix it."
553,silversmithhotel,"excellent location. every & her colleagues on reception were fantastic.  anywhere every recommended we tried & enjoyed including bars & restaurant.  all were excellent. we had a 4 day action packed vacation.  hotel was spotless,bedrooms lovely & all of the reception staff so helpful."
554,silversmithhotel,unique at the silversmith hotel was extremely helpful and overlay amazing!! there were so polite by opening the doors each time we came in and went out.he has inspired us to stay at this hotel next trip!
555,silversmithhotel,"the staff at the silversmith were truly hospitable. unique, patty, and victor were exceptional. the manager was also wonderful when we encountered a minor problem. the location was perfect for our short stay. we will return!"
556,silversmithhotel,"have review; exceptionally friendly and well informed staff who made an effort to accommodate us in a beautifully appointed, clean space.  unique at the front door is a gem!!  so were both the ladies at the front desk.  our room was quiet, even though the hotel is located right downtown near the train!"
557,silversmithhotel,"the staff was excellent. room was very clean, comfortable bed, beautiful bathroom. good location with plenty of restaurant and shops nearby, as well as millennium park. we were able to walk everywhere we wanted to go."
558,silversmithhotel,unique at the door really went above and beyond to help us all with a friendly attitude and smiling face. we were staying there for a friends engagement and it was the perfect spot. highly recommend.
559,silversmithhotel,unique made our stay so great. he was helpful and so friendly. would stay again in a heartfelt!  this is the perfect location and a great place to stay when seeing the city. nastasya was also incredible and a lovely human that made our stay amazing.
560,silversmithhotel,"excellent service, the staff were very friendly and helpful. the room and view was lovely, and the location was snatched. it is in the center of everything so i had no problem walking to my destination. will definitely be staying here again."
561,silversmithhotel,"second time staying this year for 3-4 nights. came for author event and social. front desk is always friendly, english speaking, and helpful.  severely and unique were particularly helpful with directions and services. i arrived 11:30 am on a monday and was able to check into my room early. (many hotels are now charging for this.). the king room was spacious with a huge bathroom. windows actually open which i appreciate. trip before i had a suite with sitting room and 2 vs. beds were very come. rooms are actually cleaned on demand--another rarity. housekeeping friendly, too.  when i asked for more towels or bottle water it was delivered proto.                         large lobby with nice seating for eating, drinks, meetings, work, or just hanging out.  lookout room has 2"
562,silversmithhotel,"this place was a dream. i felt like my last name was gatsby. my room was amazing.  the bathroom was *chef kiss* mind fridge in suite and microwave on request. restaurant was awesome. received a drink voucher at check in. the location is within walking distance to everything; millennium park, target, starbucks and drunken are one to two blocks away."
563,silversmithhotel,"this is my second review of the silversmith hotel. i stayed here in march 2022 and was very pleased.   my second stay (last night) was out of sheer desperation: my flight was canceled, i'd waited in line for hours for customer service, and it was late evening. i called the silversmith and they held a room until i could get back downtown. upon my arrival, victor greeted me warmly. he listened patiently to my tale of airport woe. my room was clean, quiet, comfortable, and soothing--such a relief after a distressful day! i woke to a personal note from victor with a breakfast voucher to start the day.  andre, the breakfast waiter, was welcoming and efficient. no graciously let me sit quietly in the lobby while i reassembled my travel plans. unique is still the best"
564,silversmithhotel,"always amazing service and rooms! you always feel like you’re going to see friends at the silversmith ! special s/o to unique , he’s extremely helpful and courteous. the entire team there really goes above and beyond"
565,silversmithhotel,"the whole experience was great. from the front desk and baggage handle, unique, to the room and amenities. we will definitely be back soon with our kiss. very safe and secure and also super close to everything. bonus - right next to the l making getting around the city quick and easy."
566,silversmithhotel,"since i arrived, everything was great. first of all, the hotel is nicely located, 2 blocks from millennium park, this was my first time in the windy city and the hotel's location was super convenient for tourism.   front desk girls were incredibly helpful, specially every, who is such a sweetheart, she explained everything to me in the clearest way. i loved her hospitality and kindness.   the rooms were always super clean and neat, and they have the most comfortable beds in the entire world.   i would definitely recommend silversmith hotel."
567,silversmithhotel,"the silversmith hotel on s. wabash is a great hotel with beautiful door and very well thought out comfortable rooms.  it is a short walk to the art institute, or pretty much any of the incredible art installation to be found in the loop.  but without a doubt, the best thing about the silversmith is the staff.   from the footman to the housekeeper to the clerks who checked me in….every single person was welcoming, friendly and knowledgeable.  i will definitely be back."
568,silversmithhotel,"i was so pleasantly surprised by my experience. akin greeted and checked me in. after a long day of travel, his relaxed yet professional approach to helping was so great appreciated. then throughout my stay, housekeeping was implacable. after being there for two nights, housekeeping noticed i was drink both regular coffee pads, so when i woke up and saw they left me extra, i was overwhelmed with gratitude. i was so happy that i made sure to leave them a thank you note for noticing the little things and making my morning! i don’t think that’s ever happened to me before - i always have to ask for extra. silversmith’s th floor cleaning crew is exceptional in my book!!"
569,silversmithhotel,"the staff is exceptional!! an heartfelt thank you kinship, every, unique and another young lady who worked last night (9/7) - you looked out for me and were the cream of my trip!! the hotel room was beautifully updated and clean. unlike many hotels fresh towels were restored daily without requesting, as well as a couple bottles of water. this hotel is a historic treasure in a prime location within the loop being only a few feet from the l-train station making it very convenient to travel from midway on the orange line. everything you are looking for is nearby - stores, restaurant, michigan ave are close. when traveling to chicago this is my destination to stay. buds to the entire staff!!"
570,sheratongrand,"arena is such a sweetheart. we came to la for a photo shoot and didn’t want to leave. we are local-is, but the sheraton and arena helped us to have a vacation from the santa monica area while in town. i would wholeheartedly recommend this stay to a friend."
571,sheratongrand,staff here are great. it’s always good when the welcome and check in are such a positive experience.  we very much enjoyed our stay. room was large and well equipped. the restaurant was relaxed and we enjoyed the food. easy to walk to the museums we were there to visit.
572,sheratongrand,"this hotel is not could safe. despite the strict mandate in la on wearing mass, and with micro, this hotel does not even check if you have a vaccination card on check in. also, 10-15 people go into the elevators with no signs indicating that there should be some limit to how many people should be in the elevator. we caught the elevator from our room to the lobby with no less than 12 people jumping in, and there’s no sign to say otherwise.  they’ve run out of bathroom slippers, they’ve run out of bathroom robes… putting aside the lack of could precautions, the hotel itself is very underwhelming."
573,sheratongrand,stayed for one night to go to a layers game and it was fabulous! super friendly staff with easy and quick check in and check out. had a regular king room on the th floor and it was perfect! clean and updated and the bed was so comfortable. lots to see and do with restaurant and stores nearby and within walking distance. would definitely stay here again!
574,sheratongrand,"had a wonderful stay at the sheraton grand los angeles .  although they are still not up to full service levels (lobby bar and lounge still closed) service was outstanding.  a quick note to them prior to check in sheraton as we were upgrade to a king suite (i'm platino).  they gave us coupon for breakfast in their restaurant for each morning and even allowed us to use the value ($16) towards items not 'included' (continental breakfast).  at breakfast, a manager came by and we chatted.  later that day, hanging on our door handle was a bag with a few bodies and a very nice note thanking us for our stay. tea restaurant are  also starting to open up.  the location of the hotel is also great for using the retro to get around, as there is a station just below the hotel.  and"
575,sheratongrand,"we spent 3 nights here and couldn’t be more happy with the choice. nice hotel, clean, excellent service and well located for downtown la. everyone working there were extremely nice and polite. shout out to lure and carolina at the lounge for made me feel at home, for their tips about getting around on the city and excellent customer service. if my business was in la i would recruit them. we will definitely come back here !   is thanks for the jamaica ;)"
576,sheratongrand,"the hotel is located downtown, quite close to a may’s. after we checked in, we unpacked our things. i went into the bathroom to wash my hands and it was stinking badly. it smelled like defection. i thought it was the pipes. later when i went to use the toilet i saw that there was un-flushed poor in the toilet. it smelled awful! i flushed it down immediately at there were brown stains inside the toilet. i can’t believe they gave us such a dirty room. there were 2 public hairs in the toilet and one hair in the bathtubs. that’s really unacceptable!  you can tell the age of a place easily by the switches etc. the light switches and the plugs at the sheraton have turned yellow-is (normally it takes 10+ years for white switches to change to an old yellow-is colour). even the bathtubs"
577,sheratongrand,"hotel has a good location, 2 mind walk to retro station and there’s a small mall beside (with may’s and arteries). we had a free upgrade to deluge room and the room is very spacious. they do have a list of amenities that you can call the guest service to request for (e.g shaven, microwave, shoe horn, etc), they will deliver to your room.  they also provide rewards if you request not to clean your room daily. my husband request for free bottle of water daily and the housekeeper gave him 4.   great customer service and everyone were very polite and efficient."
578,sheratongrand,"this place is very well located. i rented a car and thought parking was going to be an issue but there is an abundance of street peter parking that i was able to take advantage of. the hotel also offers valet but it’s expensive ($52 a day i believe)   the grm is probably the best grm i’ve ever been at for a hotel. on the top floor (26) with a half panorama view of the city. good equipment as well.   service was good. michel was amazing for the check in. i think because i’m a convoy member, he upgrade my fiance and i to a corner room on the with floor. this was amazing as we were now further from the elevator. perfect place for me to rest as i was tired from long work travel.   complaint: housekeeping only came once in four days. i requested for housekeeping to come on our last"
579,sheratongrand,"by far this is the best hotel we’ve been in for most of our travels. starting with the location. it’s in the middle of everything in la. very accessible to a lot of walls and restaurant (even by foot). we checked in early and the front desk (michel) staff greeted us warmly and accommodated us smoothly. even allowing us early check in, waiting any charge. the room was perfect. bottle water and starbucks coffee and tea are complimentary and they replenished them everyday. security is topnotch, with key cards needed at the back entrance and elevators to floors. guest services were always responsive to our needs. and when check out time came it was as smooth as when we checked in. bell staff were very respectful. lived up truly to its name “grand”. we will definitely book with the"
580,theplaza,amazing experience and delicious food. it was surprisingly filling with so much variety in the food. the long tea was smooth and perfectly breed. perfect for me and my friend’s thirtieth birthday celebration. thank you far for the great service!

583,theplaza,"we had high tea at the palm court. far was our server. he was absolutely incredible. he has a heart of gold. my friend is visiting, and he does not eat deserts because of his galleries. far was super sweet to accommodate that for us, and give us two rows of savory treats instead of dessert that would  have not been consumed. service was cellar! everyone was warm, and hospital, would highly recommend.  the sandwiched are absolutely delicious. each one is explosion of favors. the chess bring together an amalgamation of savory and part and fat and acid all in each bite."
584,theplaza,"our experience at the palm court for afternoon tea was fabulous because of the service provided by our server, far. he was incredibly attentive, provided excellent recommendations and when he heard we were treated our mothers to tea, made them feel incredibly special. the food and tea was delicious but the experience was truly made by the service provided by far."
585,theplaza,"expensive but worth it. one  of a kind alliance, amazing food, perfect tea, excellent champagne…the best part of the experience was our server far who was so attentive and friendly. will be back to the place for tea as soon as possible! i love new york"
586,theplaza,we had afternoon tea at the place hotel. porfirio cortes was a wonderful waiter. made our afternoon tea very so enjoyable. the chair tea was delicious. beautiful hotel and must do in ny. in a beautiful location near central park. even walking around the hotel was nice.
587,theplaza,"a first time afternoon tea at the place was a hit! and on eye of all days. shall was so attentive and helpful with everything that was served, and great at making suggestions of what tea we should try!   highly recommend for any special occasion.   the alliance is worth it alone, but the food and tea are also exquisite!   cannot wait to go back again."

590,theadolphus,"i just firstly want to acknowledge jena, grant, urban and per p who were all cellar in welcoming me at the adolphus! the hotel is stunning but their help and conversation upon arrival made what was a long international flight a distant memory! excellent service and stay"
591,theadolphus,"alicia gave such a great haircut!! so glad i found this little barbershop. she was mindful of what i needed and asked for. the room is small and more intimate, but i like how there’s not too much fluff going on. i’ll definitely be returning and making this my main barber."
592,theadolphus,"contra was unbelievable! she provided excellent service. would definitely recommend. she helped me to get a better understanding of what was being offered and included throughout my stay. when i return, i will be sure to come back and stay because i really enjoyed everything."
593,theadolphus,"from start to finish and everything in between, this was hands down the most incredible place i have ever stayed at! the reception team were so friendly and super accommodation! i believe it was a member of the security team, sam that helped me to my room and his personality was amazing and so helpful!   i also had the pleasure of visiting the sea! what they lack in amenities the truly make up for it with their service provides! many at the front was helpful and very friendly! i had a massage with chris and a facial with fox. i highly recommend requesting them for your services! chris' neck work on me helped me so much! and fox was very professional and information in helping me with my sincere routine and had such a cool vice!   overall my experience was perfect. also check"
594,theadolphus,he was very friendly and dressed very nice enjoyed my ride very much !! he seemed to like his job a lot and was very careful driving even though i was taking to him a lot thank you for having such nice people working for you it’s a pleasure to travel when you can relax and not worry about little things thanks for making my day brighter
595,theadolphus,"from the moment i arrived, the service was implacable. from afternoon tea in the french room with confine for a server to jay who was there when i struggled to open a door and his timing was perfect. to stay during christmas time was a dream. this is easily one of my favourite places in dallas."
596,theadolphus,"the barbershop at the adolphus is truly a wonderful place , you can book with them easily on the adolphus webster. they have good single malt selections in the shop , the barber are very professional and they do definitely keep in mind the clients references. alicia was the one who gave me an amazing hair cut. definitely coming back and highly recommended."
597,theadolphus,the room was immaculate. the always were luxurious and quiet. great bed! rarely do i find a bed equal to my bed at home - usually only the rite and the four seasons and the adolphus delivered! more than the room was the outstanding staff especially the bar manager. this place has an old style feeling and is a great place to explore. could be an excellent venue for corporate events or wedding. i will definitely book stays here in the future. diam was particularly helpful as well!
598,theadolphus,i needed to take a look at the hotel. i could not go on the schedule wedding venue tour that my fiancee went on. stepan very kindly showed me areas of the hotel that are used for wedding. he was so kind and polite. i appreciate it since i would not be able to see it otherwise!
599,theadolphus,"had a great time at the winter wonderland; the thing was really nice. the food was also taste, and not too expensive! wish drinks could have been a bit cheaper. special shoutout to the hostess, hannah and angelic, they were very helpful and polite for the entire dinner."
600,hotelriuplaza,"the staff were so friendly and helpful. nicely decorated modern hotel, very clean. great management..in the heart of the broadway theater district which is wonderful when catching a show or two (i went to the tiny turner broadway show which was at the theatre one block away from the hotel. had a superb time). the hotel breakfast is super impressive. will definitely stay at this property when i return to ny"
601,hotelriuplaza,i have a new favorite place great breakfast great restaurant right on property  ! modern lobby and beautiful rooms and a slice of heaven! they allow late checkout and are stuffed round the clock if you book here you won't be disappointed! hilton and epi were great and hospitable and friendly service in the restaurant! five stars !!  i'll def be back !
602,hotelriuplaza,"the location was perfect, the room that was assigned was perfect and the staff was amazing! the hotel was very clean and love the fact that they still offered breakfast everyday. i will definitely make this my go to hotel when i'm in the city"
603,hotelriuplaza,"broken shower, broken door to bathroom... low quality furniture, and room amenities.   the front desk staff isn trained.   waited 35 minutes to check in at midnight.   then agent couldn’t find my reservation m.   waited 5 minutes at front desk because agent didn’t know wife details.   almost an hour to check in! grm is closed.   breakfast isn’t a buffets.   it’s a small portion in a box.  not sold as advertised"
604,hotelriuplaza,"i am a frequent traveler but due to could-19 i was unable to go out of the country so i decided to book a quick b-day gateway here in the city. i chose the hotel rid place new york times square because of my experiences in the past with their hotels in both jamaica & area however i will never give the rid another dollar of my money. problem #1, why was every african american guest assigned to rooms on the with floor in a barely full hotel? why were we also in rooms side by side during a time when social distending is encouraged? when the issue was brought to the attention of the manager on duty, diego, i was advised that the hotel chooses rooms random upon check in but if that is the case why did i have questionable guests blasting music & smoking marijuana next to me when i"
605,hotelriuplaza,"other reviews have expressed how great a location this hotel is in.  yes, hotel rid place is only one block away from times square.  but, what makes hotel rid place extra special is that it’s located in the heart of the theatre district on restaurant row.  there are two major theatre productions on the same street as the hotel.  that means you only have to walk a few feet to get to theaters.  it was so nice being able to walk directly to the theatre box office, purchase tickets and eliminate all those online surcharges and fees.  if you are in town to catch a show, this is the hotel for you.  if you are not in town to catch a show, this is still the hotel for you.  the staff here is extremely warm and welcoming.  i was received by radio and he was extremely accommodation."
606,hotelriuplaza,"the room was so clean and enough space. i know it’s really rare in ny. i could stay as my home during the stay.   during my stay, elevator had an issue and stopped for a while. the announcement to notice guests was a bit surprised sounds and speed of speech. i felt it was not friendly to the non native english/spanish speaker."
607,hotelriuplaza,"the rooms are small, but are perfect for 1 or 2 people. there's a fridge, which is good for snacks/beverages. the hotel also provides 2 bottles of water every other day. the breakfast buffets has a variety of fruit, coffee, parties and hot items. definitely recommended due to walking distance to nearly all broadway theaters."
608,hotelriuplaza,make sure you book online or get confirmation number over phone. was charged over $500 for one night stay!! quoted rate over phone $270 i at to the hotel at am and was too tired to find another hotel. it was a nice hotel but definitely not worth $500+ because of this i will not be staying in any of the properties.
609,hotelriuplaza,"nice hotel on th avenue - so location is quite central to times square, port authority bus terminal.  room was ok.  it had no tea service which was unfortunate and the mind bar was only stocked with water.  i've stayed in rid in ran canada and echo ribs jamaica and sadly ny didn't really come up to those standards.  wouldn't rush back."
610,swissotel,"valet service was not that great. specifically mr ""make me smile"" wanting a tip for what.... terrible service! gave him a $35 tip requesting my car be left right in front... he put it in another hotel parking lot and then it took over an hour to get it back. the room didn't have the view of the fireworks like they told me... that was very disappointing.  the view of the ferries wheel was nice however we did not get what i paid for. that picture with the red light to the left... that our view of fireworks 🎆 😔"
611,swissotel,worst employers very rude and liar. they had to make me upset and make me yell upon check in. also the employee was very rude and racism. i will never go back. the rooms smelled really bad and heat wouldn’t work. i also canceled my next trip there due to this experience
612,swissotel,"the room was so detailed from shower caps, pillows, blankets and sheets. my funny is such a man so the details that pleased him were the umbrella as well as an emergency flashlight. they may seem minimal however most hotels downtown do not offer these benefits."
613,swissotel,"this was my very first experience here at the swiss, obeddie hawkers went above and beyond to make sure me and my queen brought in 2024 together with an amazing lakeside view. thank you so much the swiss has now become my go to."
614,swissotel,"this was our second visit to the swissotel and we enjoyed it just as much as our first visit. the front desk associate, muhammad, was very friendly and answered all our questions. we requested a premier corner room, specifically for the views of the city, river and the lake. we were on the and floor this time.  we think this is the perfect size room too. not too big and certainly larger than a standard room. this room offers an almost panorama view of chicago.  the fitness room on the word floor is a great facility and offers an even better view of the city.  we will definitely be back!"
615,swissotel,"the blanket between the sheets was dirty and had a large see (or other) stain.  our room was next to the elevator and the walls were not sound proof, we heard the elevators going up and down all night."
616,swissotel,"this place is great! we stay here as a result of a not so great experience at a hotel not too far away….the swiss was awesome!! i can tell you that we loved our room, everything and cannot say anything negative!! we stayed 2 nights and tried to rearrange our calendar to stay another night or two, but couldn’t make it work."
617,swissotel,"the view was spectacular, the room was clean and fresh. upon arrival the staff was very helpful and welcoming. location of the hotel was perfect and we felt extremely safe. the hotel itself was absolutely beautiful."
618,swissotel,"nice hotel, the location was perfect . close  by river walk close to other restaurant around and shopping. big plus to see the fireworks 🎆  and the palm was amazing 👏. only  little disappointed was no big tub in the room and no more pool. nice bar in the lobby and was tree was beautiful.good location very quiet 🤫."
619,swissotel,we just spent 3 nights at this hotel while visiting the city to soak in the christmas festivities. we normally stay using two popular hotel chains but found a special on travelzoo that was better than their prices.  this hotel seems to have a view out of every room because of it's triangular shape. we had a view of the river and did not pay extra for it. at check-in are requested to be away from the elevator bank for noise reasons and they accommodated me. no one ever mentioned that i had booked using travelzoo and i don't feel i received any different treatment because of it.  the hotel room was over 300 sq ft which is large by big city standards. they were clean and quiet. never heard anyone in the halls or in the next rooms. it was just three blocks off michigan avenue and we
620,thebryantparkhotel,"the bryant park hotel has now become our go-to place to stay in ny.  it's literally steps from everything, but feels hidden behind its historic facade.  the rooms are large.  the morning coffee and puffing are great.  we've never had to wait for an elevator.  but it's the warmth and genuineness of the staff that makes it such a gem.  to in particular has taken great care of us our last two stays.  we'll be back."
621,thebryantparkhotel,"me and my girlfriend stayed bryant park few weeks ago. i can’t express how much fun we had at colon, absence music drinks that woman made for us was incredible. he is a very skillful manager and he stepped in behind the bar and created best drinks(old fashion) we ever had. his crew is very friendly and kind. we loved the place and definitely coming back next year. 10 out of 10."
622,thebryantparkhotel,i cannot praise this hotel highly enough. we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and we’re made to feel incredibly special. all the staff were amazing but i have to say josephine kinsella on reception made the trip especially memorable.  the room was spacious and super clean. we never had to ask for anything- we even had extra amenities left in our room as i knew we were arriving late and needed extra dangers. a lovely bottle of fig was left for us to celebrate with too!  we will definitely be back
623,thebryantparkhotel,"my husband and i had a wonderful stay at bryant park hotel. all the staff were so friendly, efficient, and helpful. a special thanks to to at reception who went out of her way to look after us with recommendations for excursions and organizing a kettle and teabags in our room.  nothing was too much trouble. the room was clean, spacious and a pleasure to come home to each day. the position was so central. the extra touches like cold water in the for were much appreciated. i highly recommend."
624,thebryantparkhotel,the entire experience was amazing. the room was copy and the staff was extremely accommodation and knew us by first name !  the club colon was also an excellent experience .  will definitely  stay here when i return to ny!
625,thebryantparkhotel,"we loved our stay at bryant park hotel - the front desk team who helped us was amazing the entire time and to was incredible. she was so kind and helped us with our double booked stay. the hotel is beautiful, and the rooms are so spacious and bright, which is was a huge plus for new york. everything was very clean. we only gave it 1 star less than 5 because the bed was not super comfortable. if you like firm beds, you will be at home here! overall we would definitely stay again!"
626,thebryantparkhotel,"the bryant park hotel is our “go to” hotel when vacationing in new york. the warm staff, perfect location and the large wasteful rooms make staying at this ironic hotel a special experience.  we are also most appreciative of the kind personal hospitality extended to us by the gracious guest service agent, to kinsella. she’s great!"
627,thebryantparkhotel,this is a beautiful hotel located just off th avenue and in the heart of milton new york. on arrival we are treated very well by to kinsella on the desk who made us feel very welcome and helped resolve  any small issues we had. the hotel bar is very nicely set up and the restaurant had good quality food
628,thebryantparkhotel,"check-in was quick and efficient.  room is small, spare and feels like a college dormitory room.  there are few amenities.  for example, there is no coffee maker or hot water pot.  the room can be noisy when trying to sleep as nearby there were loud parties playing music.  the bathroom size was adequate but was freezing as the heat did not work.  in the morning, opposite the elevators is coffee and tea as well as mass produced puffing that were practically half baked.  would i stay here again?  probably not.  would i recommend it to others?  probably not."
629,thebryantparkhotel,"my husband and i just returned from a two night stay at the bryant park.  everything was fantastic from the upgrade room, to josephine at the front desk, to the young man who always helps us with our bags (sorry i do not know his name).  the hotel is perfectly located so we could walk to museums and broadway.  it was so much fun to watch the ice states from our windows on the and floor!  the service is so consistently good that this has become the only place we stay when we come to n.y."
630,thebryantparkhotel,"the bryant park hotel is my favorite place to stay in ny. it has easy access to the park, a great hotel bar and large rooms (for new york). the thing that separates it the most is the staff, particularly to at the front desk. i arrived early and was on an important call. she wrote down any questions on a paper as to not interrupt my call, walked me to the elevator and pushed the button. inside my key was a nice (and funny) note welcoming me. people like her is what separates good hotels from the great ones!"
631,thebryantparkhotel,"after complaining about the temperature and noise of the room, the whole team made our stay extremely exciting, as they did care about our complaints and found new rooms which 100% fitted to our expectations and above. the team made a brilliant job and we felt like being treated as ""special guests"" who came here for many years already, like friends. best experience in hotel i ever made. thank you siobhan (verona for taking care of the rooms, james and his for one of the best amaretto sour in town),  you can be proud of your team. can't wait to stay here again next time."
632,thebryantparkhotel,great experience. appreciate service by z (esaul) who greeted me and my taxi and helped me with my bag. the service was excellent and the location is perfect right across from bryant park. i’d definitely stay here again and if for longer i’d pay for a more luxurious room with a view.
633,thebryantparkhotel,"first  - it is the best service i have encountered in an ny hotel (special thanks to josephine from the front desk, who helped with early check-in after a long journey) second, the bathroom is spacious and elegant, which is uncommon in ny. third - the location. awesome. close to the subways, fifth avenue shops, and times square."
634,thebryantparkhotel,exceptional customer service leaders are what to and verona bring to the bryant park hotel.  the atmosphere is friendly and welcoming with a touch of always making you feel at home in one of the world's largest cities.  highly recommend this property - attached bar and restaurant with beautiful bryant park just outside the door.
635,thebryantparkhotel,i had a great experience costing my customers for a happy hour at the colon in bryant park hotel. flex control posted us all the way leading up to the event and the night of. she was attentive and practice to all our needs from start to finish. i'll definitely be back with other customers in the future.
636,thebryantparkhotel,"my stay at the bryant park hotel was exceptional. it started with a super warm greeting by to kinsella, who was so incredibly welcoming, she made me feel like i was at home. to was professional, kind and displayed a level of customer service that was above and beyond the norm. my room was spotless, copy and quiet. located right in the heart of bryant park, it was easy access to my meetings, restaurant and grand central. i highly recommend this hotel."
637,thebryantparkhotel,the staff was superb during our stay and particularly wanted to thank larry horseman who helped us our last evening with a food delivery. he was so pleasant and a true gem! we thank you all for a great stay and thank you larry!!
638,thebryantparkhotel,"the bryant park hotel is excellent, its location is perfect, adjacent to bryant park, excellent location, between th and th avenues, in the center of the city and the entertainment center, very close to subways stations - a 2-minute walk (at the end of the block), excellent hotel service, willingness to help with any question / need that rises special thanks to: ray, shaven, paul and john."
639,thebryantparkhotel,i recently stayed at the bryan park hotel for business.  the hotel itself is generally located and was a fantastic experience made all the more enjoyable by to k at reception.  looking forward to my next stay.
640,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,great place and good value close to downtown within walking distance.  good and drink was a good value too.  close to dart for transportation- staff was very helpful and information- won’t go wrong with this hotel.
641,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"i enjoyed my stay at this hotel. i came to town to meet with friends and to watch my cowboys lose to the kings. anyway, user dropped me off from the airport and there were lots of people coming to the hotel in taxes and class dresses. there was a ball at the hotel that evening and i felt like i was staying at a happening place! hotel staff were very friendly and i enjoyed the breakfast bar and evening cocktail at the alcohol bar."
642,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,attended the bouchercon mystery convention and spent five days at this excellent property. my room was spacious and i enjoyed three of the restaurant/bars on site. staff was welcoming and gracious and helped me when i had teach problems with my phone
643,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"i wasn't sure what to except when i attended a conference in this hotel.  everything i needed was in one site, which was great since i had no transportation. the hotel was spacious and provided multiple locations for meetings as well as snacks and beverages as part of the event.  i have no idea if the snacks and beverages are normal for conferences but it was a nice surprise."
644,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"the heart is a beautiful property, very clean and comfortable. the staff is amazing, friendly, knowledgeable, eager to be of service. the centennial restaurant is great. very good food. even the penza at the coffee shop was great-delicious and great crust. the conference rooms were logistically situated, easy to move from one to another easily."
645,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"thanks for such a warm reception and pleasant stay. this conference is a week i long for each year as we travel to places throughout the us. heart regency dallas, you met the standard and did not disappoint in any way. thank you!"
646,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"beautiful hotel. i will stay here again.  it was my visit to the dallas area and i was very impressed with the hotel, staff and restaurant.  i will highly recommend this hotel to family and friends who visit the dallas area"
647,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,it was an average hotel stay. the service was good and it was clean. the pool is small and in full sun with the building reflecting the sun as well. cleaning staff was noisy. my room did not have a microwave which would have been useful for my dietary needs. overall it was an enjoyable stay.
648,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"overpriced and didn’t get the room i booked and repaid for! front-desk manager couldn’t care less, immediately telling me my only option was to choose between to downgrades (with no refund). great hotels offer upgrade when they screw-up. not downgrades! plenty other better choice in dallas!"
649,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"room comfortable, dining was average for this type of hotel. pool area needs a face lift. did not spend a lot of time at hotel .i slept well . would be nice at the price of these rooms to include an airport scuttle."
650,thebiltmore,"love our stay at the baltimore! our comfort was the priority. valentine made sure we were comfortable and made us feel like his personal guests! the customer service, the details, the comfort along with the personal attention provided us by valentine made our stay 5 star! rebecca shivers"
651,thebiltmore,exceptional service specialist from a gentleman called valentine. beautiful hotel and very kind staff. rooms are clean and beds very comfortable. breakfast a little over rate but overall a beautiful hotel and a great experience. great for families and meeting.
652,thebiltmore,this was my second stay and i absolutely love this hotel!  a very nice employee named valentine showed me the crystal ballroom and the emerald room.  they were both so amazing!  i had a glass of vine in the gallery bar too. the beds and pillows are so comfortable.  we always stay here while in los angeles!
653,thebiltmore,the hotel was beautiful and the service was exquisite the people really was nice and friendly the room was comfortable the view was not the best it looked out on the rooftop and that was flattering i definitely would recommend to others and the price was right
654,thebiltmore,"mold all over the shower. i asked them to fix it or change rooms. they told me it would be taken care of but when i returned at midnight after being gone all day, nothing had been taken care of, the hotel itself was nice but rooms unacceptable, and customer service u acceptable. upon checkout i told them how unhappy i was and they took one day of parking fees off. i couldn't shower for two days, i don't think that is a true reflection of how unacceptable the situation is was."
655,thebiltmore,"so disappointed!  the lobby is stunning, then you exit the elevator on your floor to be overpowered by the smell of cheap air freshness, when you got to our room we had  two they tiny beds (reservation said two doubles but these beds were only slightly bigger than a twin).  our bathroom was covered in little hairs which i wiped up that night but oddly they resurfaced the next day after room service came.  we were hungry upon check in and it was late so i called room service from the room phone to find out that they haven’t offered food service since the start of could.  it is obvious that this was once a beautiful hotel and it was very disappointing and so sad to be a guest here now."
656,thebiltmore,the kiss loved it here. would definitely recommend this hotel clean rooms friendly and courteous staff. extremely helpful with finding things to do around the city of los angels. everything was pretty much within walking distance.
657,thebiltmore,"beds are not comfortable.  hot tub was not working, pool is cold.  room ac didn’t work.  the hotel itself is beautiful with a lot of history.  the location is central.  the center rooms are loud from the ac noise.  check in and out was easy.  the rooms are cleaned daily."
658,thebiltmore,"be warned i booked my trip for four days which was a total cost of $1400 on january 4 they took a deposit for $1900 off my credit card, which is held on my credit card and i’ve just found out will take 30 days to be released on my credit card because i live in canada i checked out on the eighth paid the balance of my bill the next day on january 8 they put an additional hold on my credit card of $1450 so the currently a holding on my credit card 3 1/2 thousand dollars and i’ve already paid the bill of $1400  in addition, they didn’t clean our room one day and all they could say was sorry we forgot"
659,thebiltmore,"we found the hotel nice decorated for christmas, even though  it was taken down  too early ,  the morning of january and  is one of the first hotel in united states that don’t offer water in the room , even though you can ask for it at the front desk . bartenders were rude , come and spite prices  super expensive , breakfast at the hotel restaurant was $ 75 per person plus tip and taxes , crazy price for breakfast .  another down side  is that just 2 blocks away from this hotel ,  is where all the homeless are situated . we felt very safe in the area !! very pleased with the housekeeper that clean the room every day !!"
660,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"daughter and i felt safe and comfortable (beds were great), but the quality/appearance/condition of the room could be improved. sink had cracks in it and there was weird effective tape around the bathroom mirror that was damaged. great location to convention center, and the tunnel under central station was very useful, though you can't go back through it after pm. a card reader for after hours access to the tunnel that cuts down on distance and time would be great."
661,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,i really enjoyed my recent stay at the heart regency dallas.  the hotel accommodations were what i would expect and the staff was very helpful and made my stay an enjoyable one.  i did enjoy the restaurant and other accommodations at the hotel. thanks to all at the heart regency dallas
662,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"very disappointed with this hotel. the brand and price point set my expectations at a higher level than they delivered. the staff were very helpful and friendly but the hotel needs to be upgrade. the carpets are old and tired, the beds are gripped/torn around the base, the air-conditioning is noisy and you don't even get a bottle of water in the room. housekeeping do a great job and the rooms were very clean and the bedding was made everyday. however, there are better option at the same or lower price in dallas."
663,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,do better heart. this business stay was akin to staying at a dated hilton garden inn or some 3 start hotel. the views were nice and having a bar inside was great. basic rooms... thanks for the ear plugs however when the train horns go off at the wee hours of the morning. no ear plugs can help prevent you jolting up from bed....
664,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"convenient location when attending the may bailey hutchinson convention center dallas. very friendly and professional staff, willing to assist in anyway possible. clean and well prepared room and delicious food at the restaurant!"
665,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"the heart regency is still a good option for a conference hotel- easy to navigable etc.  the property is dated and needs a full refresh.   rooms and common spaces were, however very clean.   the whole property is careless-as in they won’t accept cash for anything, not even drinks at the bar so be prepared on that.   the worst part of the hotel is that it is directly on top of the dallas rail station.  i stayed three nights and seriously could not sleep well at all.   they leave cheap, orange ear plugs on the night stand, with a note about the trains, which is kind of insulting.    like we know you paid top dollar for this room and it’s on the train track so here’s this."
666,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"the room was not very clean. the bed and shower are not high quality as you would expect from a 4-star hotel. the i-i did not work for my entire 4 day stay. customer service is essentially non-extent. when i asked about the i-i, they just told me to call it to troubleshoot myself."
667,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"i have the grand pleasure of travelling around the world, and i live here in the dew area - and frequent this hotel many times for my daughter's regional dance competition that brings in 100s of dancers and their 100's of parents and friends!  and how they manage like clockwork to get us in and out with our multiple baggage carts from car to hotel room and back again.. .amazing service and a smile... is best in class!    and i particularly want to call out both anthony and collins's for helping as was running solo with all this, and their extra hands and help was much appreciated!  looking forward to going back and getting them two again!  (ak dance mon in the g-wagon... be looking for me!)"
668,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"meeting rooms were bright and airy, the staff were fantastic - especially during meals. the variety of food available was better than expected. high quality and fresh fruit. meeting rooms were well maintained, and there were no issues with set."
669,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"room was clean and comfortable; staff was friendly and helpful. i ordered room service the night i arrived; they were very prompt with delivery. the portions were a little small for the price, but it was taste.  i ordered breakfast the next morning, that was much better."
670,omnidallashotel,i’ve stayed here twice before and it was wonderful. this time the hotel rooms are looking worn out.  time for omne to update and add additional staff.  there are much nicer option for a lower price (the drew) being one we just tried and loved.   the wait for room service at 9:pm was an hour. the attached/hotel restaurant all had long waits too which left us without a quick dinner option. morsels was closed so you couldn’t grab anything there.  coffee lines in the morning were long and my keurig had visible debris in the water tank. they brought up a new one and it was also dirty in the tank and had dust on the top of the machine. the attention to detail is completely lacking.   my room 1307  had no clock and the bedside outlets couldn’t hold a plug. it would just fall out so
671,omnidallashotel,this is the best hotel experience i've ever had. from check-in to check-out the customer service/ hospitality was perfect. all the staff we encountered was so nice and friendly. we received anything we requested within a matter of minutes to our room door.   this level of service was refreshing after staying at two merritt courtyards last year where we had to go down to the front desk to pick up whatever we needed (no guest should have to walk through a hotel with toilet paper).   the rooms were clean and we had excellent views. i would highly recommend.
672,omnidallashotel,"we were at the hotel for a convention and often to stay in the hotel for the convenience.  i have to say that for the price we paid it was rather disappointing.  the phone in our room didn’t work and we asked to have it fixed for 3 days.  it was not replaced until we were literally on the way down to check out.  i waited hours for the bellhop to pick up our bags from the room and they didn’t come until we called (using our own phone) again.  they claimed they tried to call us on the room phone to see if we still needed assistance but as we had been reporting to the front desk for days, we had no room phone!  finally, i was rather disappointed with room service.  dinner was deliver in cardboard and styrofoam boxes, like we had ordered door dash and yet the service fee was much"
673,omnidallashotel,hotel guest relations were horrible! tried to modify room and was lead from one person to another! also final bill charges were 500-700 more than final bill! we will never stay at this place again! customer service is horrible and they transfer or call time after time!
674,omnidallashotel,the room was excellent however no where is it listed that this hotel is the convention center hotel they need to put it in the name- $400 a night for screaming  yelling cheerleaders for the cheerleading convention is not right.  pick another hotel if you want peace and quiet and a relaxing stay.  serious false advertisement occurred here.
675,omnidallashotel,"stayed mid-week and couldn’t have been more satisfied. all employees encountered were friendly and helpful. room was clean, nicely appointed and had a great view of downtown.  breakfast at texas spice was really good!  morsel’s is a great for a quick beverage & bite."
676,omnidallashotel,"i am very disappointed with services received. i stayed at the hotel during the labor day holiday , the hotel charged me twice and has refused to refund or explain the charges. you take my card details and charge it at will, without being able to explain the charges. how do you treat your customers this way?"
677,omnidallashotel,"absolutely horrible. at check in you’re given a sheet with dining option and hours of operation. it’s bonus. if you plan on eating at hotel at night, forget it. they close up early. front desk doesn’t even know hours and say they’re confused"
678,omnidallashotel,"we spent 4 nights for a wedding held in dallas. this is our second time staying here and per usual, omne dallas did not disappoint.   the location was in close proximity to many sights.  our room was on the with floor and had a beautiful view of the city.   the room itself was updated. the rooms appeared well cleaned. this is quite important to us post-could.  for those those that plan to stay here and have kiss, the pool vice is not family-tormented although families are very welcomed. at least that was the case while we were there. i would not count this against the hotel as it is so fabulous i could see hanging out here as on a girls weekend."

680,sheratongrand,"i am extremely disappointed with my stay at this hotel. the particular room that i had, had a stain on the bed sheet, dirty towels in the cabinet where the fridge is, dirty borders from a previous guest left wiped on the seaboard , and if the room was this dirty, i can’t even imagine what i didn’t notice was also dirty . it’s a shame i didn’t see these things until the last day . if i catch the coronavirus, it will be because of this hotel room. other than that, i went out on my first night, and when i came back to the hotel, the door was locked and i had to wait outside for 45 minutes for another guest to let me into the hotel . i was not notified that the door would be locked, nor informed of an alternate entrance i could have used after hours.. you would think i would at"

682,sheratongrand,"i read a bunch of reviews on this property prior to booking for my first trip through la. some were pretty harsh. but i’ve never had any issues with sheraton so i booked. boy am i glad i did.  i was warmly greeted by every staff member upon arrival. the check in process was lawless. i felt valued and welcomed.  my room was bright, fresh and clean. plenty of outlets for charging, wonderful sitting couch. spotless bathroom. come bed.  the hotel is connected to a cool place where i watched many people enjoying themselves in the spring air. the retro is directly below so access was just an elevator ride away. the value for this property was great. easily could go for more. if i ever return to la i will stay here.  as side note: i tried the joy tea. oh my god. wonderful"
683,sheratongrand,"stayed here from aug 18-20  as soon as i walked in the hotel, i was greeted by an impressive lobby. check-in was quick and the associate was friendly. got up to the with floor and as soon as i stepped out of the elevator, my senses captured the nasty smell of marijuana. disgusting!!! although the room was very inviting, the excusable odor of marijuana in the halfway was not what i expected from a ""grand"" hotel. each time i walked that halfway, i felt like throwing up. i know that the hotel knows about this smell because there was one time that housekeeping staff seemed to have sprayed something to hide the odor, but was unsuccessful. it still smelled. and it was very strong.   thank you though for such a restful alliance in the room but that marijuana odor surely happened my"
684,sheratongrand,"stayed here one night and woke up to itchy, red bites all over my back, shoulders and hands. confirmed to be bed bug bites by a dermatologist. i called the hotel to let them know what happened and the employee had the audacity to tell me “that room was recently reported for bed bags.” utf!? why continue to sell a room that has a bed bug infestation that you’re fully aware of!? disgusting."
685,sheratongrand,"check in was smooth and they managed to get me a room immediately upon arrival which is much appreciated, even though it was a corner accessible room. no complaints about the bigger space, just didn't like to be at the far end away from the lift and having to drag my heavy luggage on carpeted aisle. hotels really should do away with carpets in the aisle!  being on the low floor, the noise at night was bad, could hear the traffic all night, something i didn't experience during my last stay 2 years ago. guess beggars can't be chooses, apparently this was the best room they could offer cause i arrived early.   was disappointed though that apparently late check out is no longer guaranteed for convoy gold members; the value of the gold status has dropped so much in value since"
686,sheratongrand,"the hotel just located right on top of the retro station, surrounded by shopping walls and place to hangout. there are lot of homeless people on jewellery district, but they didn’t bother me, please take note if it is a concern for you.  i feel welcome and safe to stay in this hotel, as i was travel alone and i am very happy with it."
687,sheratongrand,"i am a merritt member and in addition to my personal travel, i travel a lot for work. i can tell you that this has been my best experience ever! and this has to do with the team members. from check in to the club lounge, everyone has been great! the hotel itself is awesome. it’s in a perfect location. the entrance to transit system is literally behind the hotel. there is a place there too. a walgreen and rite aid are directly across the street. there are plenty of other arteries in walking distance too. i mean when i say this place is in the perfect location it really is. oh. the grm is nice too and located in the with floor. you get an awesome panorama view of the city. the lounge is on the with floor as well and there you get another awesome view.   all i can say is that i"
688,sheratongrand,"stayed 2 nights while in transit from san diego. the hotel is located at the bloc shopping center. may’s, unique, joys restaurant right next door. convenient self park at the bloc parking lot for $42 per day. get your ticket validated at valet station and you can drive in and out as many times as you want. $52 if you opt for valet parking. the hotel has its own restaurant in the basement, the district. walking distance to fig at th mall and many other restaurant. rooms are spacious, clean, comfortable bed and couch. based on other reviews i asked for a quiet room facing the back of the hotel and indeed it was quiet."
689,sheratongrand,"excellent hotel, door was sleek and modern. staff was friendly. stayed for two days, the room was the perfect size. the bed and pillows were what you expect from sheraton hotels high quality and comfort. location was excellent plenty of restaurant within walking distance."
690,silversmithhotel,"hotel seems passively operated on diverse sites. rooms outdated with old doors, shower full of lime stains, hair of previous guests on dispense, old outdated to, dirty filters in ac and very loud at night. also red stains - i hope not blood - on pillow. nowhere near a 4 stars hotel."
691,silversmithhotel,all the staff members are great! they made me feel at home! unique came outside to talk to me every morning and that made the trip even more special! i was just in town for three days but he made it a point to remember my name and speak to me every morning! if you are going to chicago il please make sure you stay at the silversmith hotel and speak to unique!!
692,silversmithhotel,the silver smith had great customer service it was very clean. they gave us free drink voucher which was awesome! and henrique the footman was the absolute best! he made the silversmith feel like home for my 3 day stay!!!
693,silversmithhotel,"i stayed only one night and i had chosen the silversmith for its excellent location just a few minutes’ walk from the art institute. the main entrance was under construction so i had to enter through the bar, but then the reception was already extremely friendly.  when i entered the room, i could hardly believe my eyes. it was luxurious, huge, with a magnificent bathroom all for a reasonable price. i went to the bar only to consume my welcome drink, but was seduced to have the southern crisp shrimp – it was awesome. service was polite and efficient. next morning, i had breakfast in the hotel, again the excellent service with the warm smile. needless to say, everything in the room, the bathroom sparkling clean. cannot recommend it enough."
694,silversmithhotel,"i stayed here for four nights. i chose this hotel due to its proximity to the blue and green line, which i used to travel to/from o'hare and mccormick place. having said this, the front of the hotel faces the ""l"" train tracks and i assume the rooms facing the street must deal with loud train rattling. i, fortunately, had a room that faced ""inwards"" and even though i heard the ""l"" on occasion at night, i felt it was overall quiet and i slept very well. my room was a bit underwhelming but it had everything i needed and the bed was very very comfortable. no in-room safe. the bathroom came with a standing shower. the hotel is one block from millennium park. you can walk everywhere, which i love. great shopping and restaurant in walking distance. would definitely stay here again."
695,silversmithhotel,"great location, comfortable beds and helpful and friendly staff. unique (footman and valet) was particularly accommodation and cheerful.   the location truly cannot be beat if you’re looking for time in the loop. highly recommend!"
696,silversmithhotel,"i had a pleasant one-night stay at the silversmith for a business trip.  i took users instead of public transit, but two retro stops are close by.  the silversmith is within walking distance to the willis (ne sears) tower, palmer house hotel and conference center, and the federal courthouse.  the neighborhood is marginal, and i had an incident where a group of young men surrounded me and tried to intimidate me while i was waiting for an user.  the hotel is nicely appointed with premium-looking finished.  my th floor junior suite was spacious, clean, and well insulated from the sound of the retro below, although it would benefit from brighter lighting.  i had a great burgher from the adams restaurant (the hotel should consider offering room service).  the front desk staff were"
697,silversmithhotel,"an interesting boutique hotel with attractive overall door and friendly service - the main issue is the location, which is somewhat safe at night.  i would not return.  specific: * nice overall atmosphere, with understand art deck saying, although always a bit drab as mostly grey tones.  small entryway leads to restaurant/bar and front desk in same area with elevators - bit cramped layout. * location is generally convenient in downtown and close to millennium park, but not a great street as right next to l train.  in fact, i would not recommend walking around this block late at night - there is no sense of safety and very few people around. * they charge $20 nightly amnesty fee covering mostly normal hotel related services, but also a daily drink voucher * room was"
698,silversmithhotel,"this hotel is lovely. the rooms are gorgeous. but the staff made my visit so special. i am so grateful to every at the front desk, unique at the front door and victoria/victoria (s?) who were so kind to me at rush hour when i was trying to get to midway.   i cannot express my gratitude enough for how wonderful and thoughtful these individuals were. they went above and beyond to help me and truly made me remember that there are still wonderful, daring people out there that will still take the time to help a stranger.  i highly recommend this hotel.  the location is wonderful - i went for a great walk down to the lake - got to see a lot of chicago.  if you get a street facing room - put on rain white noise and you'll sleep beautifully.    thank you to these amazing people at"
699,silversmithhotel,"i had the best experience here! we booked our team here for a tradeshow. we had about 10 rooms. everyone one of us had a great time. staff is great, rooms were great, atmosphere was great! would 10/10 recommend! thank you all for a great experience! we will see you next year!"
700,omnidallashotel,"if i could give zero stars i would. i paid for early check in, the room overlooked the roof.. it had wires hanging from the ceiling where the light should have been and lascar/make on counter from the previous guest. i called, they came and re cleaned bathroom then said they had no parts to fix light.  i’d come in early so wanted to sleep a few hour before afternoon meetings and one of the staff tried to enter my room. they didn’t clean our room we ran out of toilet paper, towels and none of the outlets would hold a plug. then the hairdryer was broken i called and they said so sorry not a priority. (i’m really?! i’m only here for a professional conference and i can’t go with wet hair) finally the worst is they never did clean, and i’d asked for noon checkout but at 7:am"
701,omnidallashotel,"the only hotel to stay in if you are attending a convention at may bailey especially in august when it’s degrees + outside!  room was big, bed was big, shower was big! very comfortable but disappointed by lack of bathroom and slippers.  loved the make up mirror though and plug sockets by the bed.  two bottles of water replenished daily and goose come cast available on to. amazing service when i asked for a kettle as the water from the coffee machine tasted like, you guessed it coffee! no kettles but they bought me a brand new out of the box coffee machine at pm so i could enjoy a cup of tea!  i had room service penza from pegasus it was delicious!  if i attend another convention in dallas i will definitely stay here."
702,omnidallashotel,"queen at check in was knowledgeable, efficient, friendly and engaging! she was losing her voice and we commented and she told us that she was supposed to have the day off but was called in and as to not leave her co-worker alone, she came in anyway. we noticed her co-worker brought her a hot tea! it was very refreshing to experience such positively and family environment."
703,omnidallashotel,you can’t get water at this hotel between the hours of 2-6 on the morning. i woke up in the middle of the night wanting some water and i called the front desk and there is no way to get water. bring water if you can.
704,omnidallashotel,"in town for the week for the international science & engineering fair with a mix of adults and high schools. the front desk was terrific; friendly helpful and accommodation. the rooms were spacious, clean and quiet. the elevator system was super efficient which was needed since we were all on the same schedule. the convenience of being attached to the convention center was fantastic. having a bunch of restaurant available was very convenient and helpful in feeding teenager all week. the staff in all of the restaurant were consistently the nicest i have experienced in a long while. if is returns to dallas in the future, the omne will be my first choice!"
705,omnidallashotel,"the hotel has a modern and updated feel to it, from the lobby to the rooms. i didn't have much run in with staff, but when i did, they were attentive. room service was good and relatively quick. would stay here again."
706,omnidallashotel,pro: first of all...this hotel is in a great location and close to the convention center. the staff greet you as soon as you pull up and assist with luggage. the grounds are well-kept. check-in was easy. we were on the with floor facing the city. the pool is probably the best part of this hotel. it is located on the th-floor roof and has amazing views of the downtown area and the reunion tower. they do offer day passes for non-hotel guests. you have to have a room key to access the pool and grm areas. there is a pool bar on-site that has various hours. the pool is open year-round and heated with a large raised hot tub. the only downside is there is no staff to keep the kiss under control and the little took over the hot tub and had no supervision on the weekend. it was a bit
707,omnidallashotel,"great hotel for the traveling professional that loves a good grm.  clean hotel with great restaurant option.  i really enjoyed dining in the sports bar (quick option between sessions), and breakfast at texas spice was super mummy.  the grm was one of the better ones that i've had the opportunity to use, very clean, tons of equipment.  my only negative was that i could not get a hold of a face towel, ll.  but overall great stay."
708,omnidallashotel,"the omne dallas hotel is an excellent location for those attending a convention at the convention center. it is connected to the c and is convenient to get to and from.   it is also within walking distance from many attractions, restaurant, and downtown districts.   the hotel itself is in fair condition.   the rooms are nicely appointed. clean and spacious. the rooms have a southern or “cowboy” theme. they have wall coverings that look like and resemble denis. neat, but they do make the rooms dark.   i would recommend staying at this hotel, especially for convenience if you are in town for an event at the convention center."
709,omnidallashotel,"i been visiting this property for over 15 years on a monthly basis. it's sort of like being on a cruise ship as you have a variety of restaurant choice, great grm, and nice roof top pool. ask for upgrade to any 02 room. they are end of hall suites that are rock star status. negative is if cone. in town some property restraints are closed events. property is super clean. the bathroom in the 02 suites are amazing."
710,virginhotels,had a lovely stay at the  virgin.   a big shout out to dandy at the front desk!  he was so accommodation!  made our stay a real pleasure.  the restaurant s are terrific and hospitality around every corner.  can’t say enough…great guy…great stay!  thanks dandy!
711,virginhotels,"we came to chicago for a bachelorette party and the location of the virgin hotel was ideal for all of our events and plans outside of the hotel,  the amenities in the hotel were everything we could have wanted. everything from champagne to the amazing staff, was more than perfect. i could not recommend virgin hotels more for any bachelorette/girls trip/ party. they do it all with excellence."
712,virginhotels,our witness else was amazing!! so nice and had such great energy. we got some amazing service and she had a lovely attitude. breakfast was so fun with her. the food was also great. would highly recommend to anyone looking for breakfast with a great atmosphere in chicago.
713,virginhotels,"we had branch at ms rickets with our friends, and our witness else was so sweet and attentive and we had such a fun and great experience! food was so mummy and you should definitely should check this place out when you’re in chicago!!!!!!!!!"
714,virginhotels,"friend i was meeting in chicago was staying here, so didn't really get to ""pick"" the hotel but i have to say, i'm really glad i stayed here!  mostly because of the great customer service with converge (had specifically helped me)!  i reached out a few weeks before to arrange car picked from airport and had was super fast, attentive, and helpful!   once staying at the hotel i was really happy with the room, view, and overall stay!  my only note would be the bar upstairs seemed small, and should definitely prioritize guests who want to partake."
715,virginhotels,"booked through apex travel, what an absolutely astounding surprise. i’m not often bowed by a hotel as hotels tend to be pretty standard affairs, but this hotel was simply awesome and surprising in the coolest ways.   first, the room. i had a king suite. it was thoughtfully laid out with distinct living areas. the bed was super comfortable and the room amazingly quiet given the proximity to the nearby l train. the shower….a shower with water pressure and an optional handed shower head too!   no risky-drink single use shower gets….instead full size bottles! large counters and mirrors in the rest of the bath too.   the living room portion with a table for 4 and a handy in-room refrigerator. just great all around.   had dinner the first night at miss rocky’s which, we only learned"
716,virginhotels,"virgin hotel in chicago is gorgeous. it has the pre-existing bones of the original art deck from the time the building was built and the sick interior design thoughtfully curate in their rooms. access to delicious food downstairs at miss rich’s and drinks on the rooftop bar rise with amazing views of the city. the staff was kind and attentive to the needs of me and my friends including had who was ultra helpful and always fun to talk to, and candle was great too. the experience was excellent and will be back again soon!"
717,virginhotels,"my best friend & i were able to visit the area and attend the museums. had was very helpful when we asked questions regarding the local area/places to visit. we will definitely be returning, thank you!"
718,virginhotels,"my experience at this hotel was nothing short of amazing! it’s beautiful and clean! the rooms are spacious and the accommodations are spectacular. it’s settled right in the city and close to everything. had, at the front desk, was so kind and helpful! he is efficient and makes your stay feel like home away from home!"
719,virginhotels,"i'm not sure if she was a manager but brittany at the front desk was amazing in helping us resolve an issue, she was prompt and went above and beyond. i was very impressed.  me and my friend had an incredible time. i would absolutely recommend staying here, it's in a great location, it's beautiful and the rooftop bar had an event that we had a blast attending!"
720,thebiltmore,"come double deux room to share with my friend.   we chose the baltimore because of the unfordable price our conference had arranged and the history of the hotel.  it is lovely!  the beautiful ceilings, carpets, wood panelled elevators and more.  staff were all very friendly and accommodation."
721,thebiltmore,"not very impressed with the upkeep and management. no room service and no food available after pm. parking is a haste and not easy. at $45 you would think there would be luggage drop off service at least. only one person at check in. went on a walk inside this historic hotel. letters had fallen off from various permanent signs and never fixed. was never told prior to booking room that an outdoor event with loud, thumping music would be happening til midnight. the large always to the rooms had these cheap, small picture frames sporadically placed.  looked like a hotel 6. seems they are hoping that their ""historical"" significance brings people in. i would recommend a different hotel downtown."
722,thebiltmore,"i had no clue what i was booking until i showed up. now! so much history here! 100 years this october. i spent all dinner watching scenes from the over 300 moves filled here so that i could go to the actual spots afterwards. i overheard valentine mention the secret room to someone while i was looking at the history wall photo (st scars here, presidential speeches, etc) and asked if i can see it too (one of the places i wanted to see)! he ended up giving me a full on impromptu private tour of the whole place, opening up ballroom even. he knew the backstories and hidden gems that you’d never know just by staying in this gorgeous hotel. this has hands down been one of my favorite places to stay so far. when you come, ask for valentine! you won’t regret it!"
723,thebiltmore,excellent stay! has old hollywood vice. the entire staff was super friendly. the room was clean and comfortable. i enjoyed the indoor pool. the breakfast was amazing and highly recommend. great location and places nearby. would return in the future!
724,thebiltmore,staff took an extra interest in my comfort and the room was beautifully decorated. the heritage of this historic place has been nicely preserved.  beautiful hotel! the swimming pool and grm are on a whole next level compared to other hotels.
725,thebiltmore,"if you come to los angeles area, millennium baltimore hotel is the place to be, the staff at the front desk are superb, considerate and understanding, they will do above and beyond of their call of duty to help. an icon architecture in downtown la  cater the extravagance class a++ hospitality and service to its patron. when you inside the millennium baltimore hotel you will feel the grandeur of the building and its interior, the rooms were classic mixed with elegance and modernistic setting. consider this as your and home when you come to los angeles, the millennium baltimore hotel."
726,thebiltmore,"this is a historical hotel built in 1923 so when i reached there it was already 100 year old. since this hotel was built 100 years back, we can see the grand architecture  and decoration of royal style. those who are use to very modern properties may find this hotel worn out but the grandeur of its style gives off royal palace vices. lobby is simple, service at front desk was swift , room was good, very clean and well appointed. all the amenities was there in the room, even a walk in closet too. i was on room only plan so ca not say about the breakfast however tried food in the restaurant (bar) which was good. staff were helpful, some were smile. they speak a little more than avare english, generally speak spanish only.  good internet speed. only downside was bathroom"
727,thebiltmore,"room was clean upon arrival and the hotel was able to accommodate my early check in request (with a fee). the room was quite spacious and had a large amount of closet space.  the beds were pretty comfortable, but the only downside is that the pillows would flatten quite easily.  staff was friendly and helpful upon check-in and checkout and the online pre check in process helped speed up the process.  plenty of food option nearby with a variety of types of food. convention center was only about a 1 mile walk. convenience stores are also a short walk away.  overall, i would stay again for my next convention"
728,thebiltmore,definitely check and know all the charges before you buy   their “resort fee” was thrown in after i booked  $35 a day for what ? i already paid their daily rate and then they charge this erroneous fee   when i tried to cancel before arriving i was told i couldn’t do that
729,thebiltmore,"loved it. everything was clean and easy to check in and out. even let my two pus, who they referred to as my two best friends, stay with me. the building is a historic los angeles building with beautiful architecture. the staff were all fantastic."
730,hiltonuniversalcity,"great hotel, amazing staff, and great location! even if you aren’t going to the theme park the location is perfect for getting both into hollywood/downtown and the valley. and just to reiterated the staff were the best i’ve encountered in a long, long time!"
731,hiltonuniversalcity,"i grew up in nearby pasadena so never had a reason to stay here until i had a business trip! gorgeous views, excellent staff, great restaurant and a most comfortable bed. what more could one ask for?"
732,hiltonuniversalcity,"i continue to look forward to times i am in the area and choose to stay at this hotel.  the staff is not only very friendly, but also very personal. the location of the hotel is great, and has some dynamic views. the food in the restaurant are great, and i especially enjoy the breakfast buffets in the mornings, and the seafood buffets on weekend.  i highly recommend it."
733,hiltonuniversalcity,"our hotel stay was amazing. all of the staff members were very friendly and helpful. our room was excellent, the view was great. the dining was great 👍.  my wife and i will recommend hilton los angeles/ universal city to our family and friends  ."
734,hiltonuniversalcity,"hilton was my home away from home every time i visited la. traveling solo with a disability isn’t very easy, but the front desk supervisor, namely always made sure i was ok and had everything i needed. even if i had to leave my room to go out of town for several days, namely always  made sure i got my add room or similar. she not only made sure everything worked out for me ok, but she also made sure i was safe. i’ve  been meaning to write a nice review about my time at this hilton, but with health issues and unexpected turns in life, it has been a while since i’ve written a review and when i do return to la i hope namely is still at the hilton. the rest of the staff had been very nice and accommodation also. but i wish every hotel manager was like namely !! thankyou."
735,hiltonuniversalcity,"a hotel with a very inflated ego ,charging 5 star prices for a 2 star hotel just because of its location next to the also heavily overpriced universal studies ,shabby dated rooms which they only clean when requested. certainly the worst selection for a continental buffets breakfast i have ever encountered."
736,hiltonuniversalcity,"the hotel is right across the street from universal studies. there is a connecting halfway, which involves climbing stairs to get to a sky bridge, and a scuttle that is shared with the sheraton. the scuttle drop off and pick up point is next to the city walk. the exit from the park is probably just as close to the hotel via the halfway as it is to the scuttle stop, so it’s probably easiest to ride over and walk back. the convenience comes at a price, as this is one of the most expensive hotels in the area. however, when visiting the theme park, there are very few places to sit and rest, and those places aren’t that comfortable. so, those guests who need an hour or so rest break during the day will find this hotel much more convenient than getting in the car, driving to a cheaper"
737,hiltonuniversalcity,"hello, i stayed at this property for three (3) nights.  well, the hill walking up to the hotel is well annoying!  after leaving the train and taking the walk over bridge to the base of the hill with my luggage, i was then told that i would have to haul my bags up the hill to the hotel.  i was informed about a trap that transported people to the universal studies park, but the trap did not go to the hotels.  i suppose it was possible to take the trap to the theme park and then cross over to the hotel, but did not want to have to keep doing that.  just be aware of the hill, if you decide to choose this hotel.  of course going down the hill was much easier than walking up.  other than that, the five (5) elevators were very prompt.  the room provided ample room for storing clothes."
738,hiltonuniversalcity,"no one likes mistakes but they happen. i drove 6 hours to check in on 4/2/23 and at checking i was advised that my reservation was canceled. when i explained that i would never have canceled this trip, i was told by their on-site reservation rep that i had called in that morning and canceled the reservation. when he asked me to confirm my phone number, email address and city of residence- none of the information i provided matched what he had. so how in the world would you allow someone to cancel my reservation without the correct information or watching credit card #?!?! the hotel was sold out and he basically kept telling me i canceled it. luckily the lady that checked me was understanding, compassionate and helpful and checked me into a room. she made sure i had the correct"
739,hiltonuniversalcity,"this is my rd stay here, each being 3+ days for work since october 2022. always eat in hotel while traveling, almost always order fish/salmon.  the salmon the past two visits was good, but just that--good.  ordered salmon last night, the menu/presentation different from before and now!  amazing!  had exact same time! absolutely fine dining restaurant quality - not at all what i've experienced in hotel restaurant.   chef emit, thank you thank you!  can't wait til i'm back in town!"
740,silversmithhotel,"the hotel is lovely, the location is perfect and the staff is amazing and incredibly helpful! i came to chicago to see a show that canceled at the last minute (thanks wisp)would give more stars if possible, we’ll definitely be back sap. i highly recommend this place!"
741,silversmithhotel,"the room was very clean and comfortable, and the staff were so friendly! unique, the man who did our valet parking, was especially kind and helpful. the hotel in general has beautiful design and architecture and is also in such a great location - several restaurant, convenience stores, and attractions surround it. thank you for our stay - it is very likely that i will be back!"
742,silversmithhotel,"an excellent location on the loop. conveniently located to restaurant, theaters, and sites to visit. the room was clean and spacious! the sheets did not stay on the bed. everyone we met at the front desk and the bar/restaurant was friendly, helpful, and welcoming, especially chef jimmy. we ate at the restaurant one evening, and the food was seasoned well and delicious. it was a quiet, peaceful, and safe place to stay. we also found it easy to get to public transportation."
743,silversmithhotel,"my friend booked us a room for a long weekend in the city. she picked the hotel because it was close to the train. we got a 3-day cat pass and had no trouble getting to and from the hotel between our little outing. the hotel its self was nothing special, the staff was the reason for the 5 star review.   unique deserves his own 5-star review, from the second we pulled up to the entrance unique went above and beyond. even though we weren’t using the valet services he made sure we unloaded and marked safely.   i also want to mention the wonderful woman who was at the front desk around pm on friday the with. i wish i had gotten her name, but alas i did not."
744,silversmithhotel,"from the moment we checked in, we noticed the clean atmosphere. guest service was excellent, especially every! the staff constantly checked up on us, including housekeeping. the room itself was clean, neat, and perfect for our home away from home vacation. linen was clean and fresh. amenities were great and the location was extremely useful especially being able to walk to various places in less than 5 minutes. night staff was great as well (i can't quite remember her name, shanika, maybe), she was amazing! overall 10/10 experience!"
745,silversmithhotel,"this was by far the easiest check-in, nicest facility, and best valet crew ever!  unique especially made our stay so enjoyable and stress-free.  he’s chicago’s map when it comes to valet hospitality!  we will stay here again!"
746,silversmithhotel,our rooms on the th floor were not as luxurious as we thought they would be.   one of the rooms had a broken blow dwyer and television in both rooms were not working very well.  soaked cushions and pillows were soiled upon arrival.  nightstand lamp had a burned out light bulb.    the positive - front desk service and valet parking attendants were great and very helpful.  great location for the many attractions nearby.    not sure if i would come back to this hotel though - the rooms felt average and similar to a 3 star.  not a four star as mentioned.
747,silversmithhotel,"our stay at the silversmith couldn’t have been better. all of the staff were very friendly and helpful especially unique and every! they helped us park in the garage, carried bags and printed email that i needed. thanks again!"
748,silversmithhotel,"very nice, updated hotel. the room was clean and spacious and loved the soap in the bathroom. unique was so helpful with our bags and the haziness of the taylor swift concert happening that weekend. big thanks to unique!!"
749,silversmithhotel,"perfect location to walk easily to millennium park, the waterfront, art institute, and plenty of restaurant. room was great, comfortable bed and updated bathroom. staff friendly and helpful.  couldn’t ask for more!"
750,silversmithhotel,check in was smooth and akin at the reception was warm and friendly.  free water for guests. room service is limited but can request. there is no view obviously because of the location and the loop runs very near to the hotel. however the location of the hotel is ideal for getting to tourist places.
751,silversmithhotel,"on a four-city trip, this was by far the best hotel.  staff very accommodation.  upgrade to a suite.  convenient location.  stunning design.  i would stay here again in a heartfelt.  personal luxury at its best.  head and shoulders above the hotels in d.c. and ny (although those were prices)"
752,silversmithhotel,"please don't stay here. don't tell anyone that this little hotel is the best-kept secret in chicago. if word gets out and this hotel becomes hot,  it may be difficult for me to book my next visit, the next, and the next. don't tell anyone that be at the front desk and unique at the front door are the most hospitable, warmest, most knowledgeable hoteliers in the city. don't mention that the rooms are clean, quiet, spacious, luxurious, and very well-prices. please don't give away that the silversmith is in the perfect location for all of your chicago explorations.  seriously, i've stayed in several chicago hotels. this is the best by far. doesn't hurt that my favorite breakfast spot, goddess and the baker, is right across the street and the art institute is 2 blocks away."
753,silversmithhotel,"the room was nice with a comfortable bed and cut bathroom. akin at the front desk staff was very nice and helpful. i would stay here again.  i didn’t give it 5 stars because i thought the restaurant and bar was just okay, a bit over prices for the quality of food/drink."
754,silversmithhotel,"excellent choice! that was great! undoubtedly the best value for money,  considering the region! spacious and extremely clean room. all receptionists were also very helpful! when i return to chicago, i will definitely check availability at the hotel."
755,silversmithhotel,"outstanding is an understatement when it comes to this place & the staff. ms. every is the best, her kindness was so genuine. the location is why i picked this hotel, it is right near everything that i specifically came to see (art institute of chicago, palmer house, & chicago architecture center). so many wonderful restaurant are within blocks of this place and it even conveniently has a train stop close by. this spot is my new go-to place when i come to chicago."
756,silversmithhotel,"solo starvation. excellent & friendly front desk staff. rooms are updated, spacious and clean. stayed on the with floor, very quiet. i stayed around christmastime and was able to walk to many attractions, also close to shopping. would definitely return."
757,silversmithhotel,"i’m a musician and i basically live in hotels. from the value extended stays to the business traveller abodes, to five-star resorts, i know hotels. this is my third stay at silversmith. and chicago is full of fantastic hotels. but the perfect balance of value and amenities is a rarity. silversmith excess in this arena. a beaming bright lobby in a historic building. always friendly front desk staff. enormous rooms! two to’s (one for the sitting area, one for the bedroom). free bottles water. moulton brown toiletries. comfortable beds. large shower with great water pressure. stylish door.   but the best part is the superb location! all of the big chicago sights are within reasonable walking distance. stay here. you won’t regret it."
758,silversmithhotel,"i stayed at the silversmith for the chicago marathon and i had a perfect stay. i was most impressed with the comfortable bed, and the bathroom was luxurious. the shower was slow to drain, but a friend staying at another hotel a block away had a similar experience with their shower; it wasn’t much of a bother. i loved the bath products that were available—very high quality shampoo/conditioned/shower get. the room was clean, and although they cut daily cleaning service i did not mind, as the hotel staff notified me ahead of time and mentioned that if i needed anything then i could just ask them at the front desk. the front desk staff were so helpful and friendly. i will stay at this hotel again daytime i’m in chicago."
759,silversmithhotel,the door and spaciousness is fantastic. love the huge bathroom and come beds. irving and nastasya at the front desk were so welcoming and took care of my every need. this is a favorite hotel and my go to place in chicago.
760,sheratongrand,"the room was okay, but...  we just had some issues with surprise charges. they charge a $25 ""destination fee"" which is non-negotiate and not disclosed at time of booking.  they claim that you can get credit back if you go to their restaurant, etc.  we ended up changing our plans and went to their restaurant to get the fee created back to our account. seems manipulation. valet parking is stated to be $54 but expect $59.40/night as they charge tax on that. i'm not a fan of surprise fees. they also threatened to charge us $70 for 1 pm checkout after we were told during check-in that 1 pm checkout would be fine given our gold level convoy status.  after excavating to a manager, they dropped the charge."
761,sheratongrand,"lure and manual’s service was top notch! they were so welcoming and made our time for breakfast one to remember. the food was stocked and fresh, and the area was clean. it’s not often that you find people that care and are genuine. we know that our stay was quick and in out and i truly appreciate them making it so memorable!"
762,sheratongrand,"great location in the heart of la. 25 minutes to the cruise port. nice restaurant right in the hotel and all the employees were very nice and helpful. also, approximately 25 minutes from the airport. would stay again."
763,sheratongrand,"amazing experience at the sheraton grand hotel downtown los angeles. the service is implacable from the time your are greeted at the front entrance. the lobby is impressive and rooms are refreshed and clean as a whistle. the hotel staff from front desk, phone reception, to housekeeping is attentive and respectful. the dining experience is top notch at the district restaurant located on the hotel basement. the hotel is located in the center of the bloc shopping center where you can spend hours to enjoy multiple shops. this includes great parking valet service. there is a more unfordable 24 he parking garage directly across the main entrance if you desire. i would highly recommend the sheraton grand when staying in downtown los angeles."
764,sheratongrand,"we stay here each month when we're in la. this is an excellent base for exploring los angeles as many of the rail lines cross through the station under the hotel.  one of our most important reasons for staying here is the excellent elite lounge on the top floor of the hotel. they offer an excellent breakfast each morning and they've kept the same lounge staff for years so things are consistent. lure and manual know us by name and they do a great job of running things. the evening crew is good as well and they offer a great selection of appetizers and even a drink menu.  during the day, the lounge is always stocked with water, snacks, and a consistently working coffee machine.  the valet at this hotel is great as well. even when they are full, they hire sufficient workers to keep"
765,sheratongrand,"i recently stayed 5 nights at sheraton and unfortunately, it was a disappointing experience. the room was clean but the refillable bottles of shampoo, conditioned, and body wash were not full. also, the water pressure in the shower was appalling!!  the next day after a long day of exploring la the housekeeping chased me in the corridor with a full bottle of body wash for me to replace in the bathroom, this should have been done while they were cleaning the room.  the bed and pillows were comfortable. we stayed on level 4  and the noise level from other guests and nearby machinery (i believe the lift going up and down)  was quite loud, which made it difficult to relax in the room.  the staff was not very helpful or responsive to my concerns, which only added to my frustration. i"
766,sheratongrand,"booked a king bedded room for 5 nights direct with sheraton.  check-in went quickly and we were given a room on the with floor. it was a nicely laid out room with counter space, luggage, ranks, complimentary bottle water in the room daily, and very good i-i.  the bed and pillows was very comfortable. the fitness centre that we use of was very good.  the room was impeccably, clean and housekeeping was excellent.  the valet service was slow, dropping off the vehicle, but the fellows working in the parade when picking up the vehicle were very efficient.  the negative of the hotel/room was the air conditioning.  we could cool the room, however, in the middle of the night it was as if the system was being overcome as  the room warmed.  this made for a warm room to sleep in."
767,sheratongrand,"disappointing. upon checking realizing we had no microwave in the room we requested one immediately @ up.m) about 30 mind later, as we were leaving the hotel we stopped at the front desk and reminded them and they said they would take care of it while we were out, ""no problem, apologies"". came back 2 -3 hours later and still no microwave. called down to the desk and more apologies and ""we'll bring it right now."" 30 mind after that still no microwave and when we called this time, we were told all the microwaves were already in service and they didn't have one for us.  as i was getting into bed i noticed the fitted sheet riding up revealing gross dark stains along the side of the mattress. very unerring. by the looks of it it could have been anything from chocolate to blood. the"
768,sheratongrand,generally located and close to restaurant and shops. staff was really friendly and helpful. nice room but ac was a little bit noisy except.  lobby is great and the district bar had great drinks but i was not so impressed by the food at the district restaurant.
769,sheratongrand,"first time staying at sheraton grand.   we usually go to nearby hotels like it, live, etc. i was very impressed with the class and elegant lobby.  it's gorgeous.   the check in staff and the bellhop person was very helpful.  the valet parking is on the high side (54 daily) but you do get in-out privilege so i guess for downtown it is all right.   we got the room on the with floor and it was very nice.   clean inside, bed was quality so you don't feel the other person moving in the bed.   furniture and sophisticated and class.   price seem very reasonable given the prices of other ""less"" hotels and what i thought was definitely one of the better hotels i've stayed in the past.   definitely will consider staying here if i go to the la downtown area."
770,theplaza,"daniel brigand, guest experience manager, went above and beyond to make sure our time at the place was memorable!  he greeted us by name, posted us for a drink in the champagne bar, gave us a behind the scenes look at the ballroom and told us stories of events that have taken place there!  daniel and his team always provide second to none service."
771,theplaza,"a bit over 4 years after our last visit at this magical place we returned for a trip with close friends. in my last review i already stated that we were so happy next to staying at this wonderful place to have met so many wonderful people in this hotel. the staff is really outstanding so the biggest joy was to see so many „friends“ again still being part of the places legacy. from ready and the whole crew outside, nick and the bar team, the warm welcome at the desk to our most loved crew at the outstanding breakfast. my friends and i will always remember the hours well spent talking about life while having fresh juice, cappuccino and the delicious food. for me personally it was pure joy seeing porfirio again, who already connected deeply with us during our last visit with my"
772,theplaza,shall provided excellent service. he made our experience amazing !!! made sure to take care of all our requests. he is the best !!! we will definitely come back and do this experience again. was very attentive and made sure to check about dietary restrictions.
773,theplaza,hotel was well located and everything was a short walk away. 1/10 and that’s only because of the location. would give it a 10 however i had a terrible experience on my first night with the bathtubs water being brown and the handle falling off leaving the water running. didn’t go to sleep until am bc of the noise. didn’t even offer restaurant voucher or come room service or anything for the huge inconvenience. would have left satisfied if the team put an effort to make for the bad experience but they didn’t even try. terrible first night
774,theplaza,"the afternoon tea was wonderful.  we had an excellent server named shall khan. he was very witty and attentive, extremely helpful and willing to take pictures. the highlight was the glasses from alaska! i highly recommend dining at palm court at the place."
775,theplaza,"we had a lovely time at the palm court!! i was able to get a began option of the afternoon tea and everything was beautifully made and delicious. our server shall was also so accommodation, friendly and helpful! we will definitely be back soon!"
776,theplaza,the hotel is absolutely gorgeous!! our room and the mosaic tile bathroom was very spacious and beautifully decorated. we had a fabulous stay!! the staff was very friendly and welcoming. we were there for a wedding and everything was  fabulous. the place is everything you would expect in luxury hotel
777,theplaza,kari all was amazing! he made our tea experience great. great to know that there is still hard workers in the service industry. he also made sure that we had great pictures from different angles. definitely coming back soon thanks to kari!
778,theplaza,we came to the place for afternoon tea and had the signature tea experience. it was wonderful some especially because of the manager ashleign and cabin. they took excellent care of us and really elevated the experience. we will definitely come back!
779,theplaza,"labor and ashleign are the best! they are extremely welcoming and information! the place itself is absolutely stunning, i highly recommend the afternoon tea - specifically the place signature tea. we will be coming back and boasting another event here!"
780,hotelriuplaza,"i had a problem with dripping in the ceiling of my room which disturbed my sleep, but the hotel dealt with it very efficiently . i was moved very quickly and was very impressed at the effectiveness of the reception team. well done all involved! the hotel itself was really well situated for my trip which involved seeing several shows. breakfast was fine at the times i went-7.30 and 8.45 is. the other breakfast venue across the hall was used for the 7.30 visit which was fine. good stay all round. would stay again happily."
781,hotelriuplaza,"would i recommend this hotel ? no.  would i stay here again ? again , no.   the pro - location  the sons - the strange door in the room ( weird and dated lilac stripes on the walls) , the lack of facilities in the room - no kettle, glasses or cups, no room service, the wobbly fridge , no come chair to sit on , the safe that is bolted to a lose shelf , the shower that leads so that you have to cover the floor in towels , meaning you can’t possibly be environmental friendly and refuse them as they are stopping wet and dirty , the weird see-through screen between the bathroom and the bed area , the poor double gazing so you can hear street noise and construction works all day and night , and the slamming of doors in the corridors , and the helpful reception staff ( converge"
782,hotelriuplaza,perfect location and walking distance for times square and central park.  rid place is a very lovely hotel and i’m looking to ebook again real soon for 2024 ☺️☺️.  highly recommend booking this hotel if your going to new york.
783,hotelriuplaza,i unexpectedly travelled on my own so at check in needed to explain why & find my room after a long journey. explained the reason for my trip & was asked if i wanted a room on a high floor. i said yes before thinking & took what they recommended on the with floor. the view was great. hotel is located a very short walk from times square  where you will find everything you need from shops & cases to subways or bus stops.  all the hotel staff i spoke with were very friendly & helpful. i didn’t use the bar or have evening meals in the hotel but did have breakfast each day. what a choice! every day there were plenty of option to suit any appetite & taste. there was often quite a big queue when i was leaving breakfast so i would recommend arriving early if you can. i only needed to
784,hotelriuplaza,"this is, a full and frank, but personal review of this hotel. i recently stayed at the hotel rid for seven nights. the first impression on entering the hotel was very positive. once through the double, glass encased, sliding doors there is a glazed, shiny tile floor, with low lights hanging from the ceiling. the counter is to the right. with come seating and low coffee tables around the edge, and nice door, the first impressions were good. during my stay the counter staff were always friendly, unapproachable and efficient. a special mention to aime who met me with a smile and a warm welcome. check-in was quick. just the usual few questions and request for id. then the supply of information about check-out and meal times. i knew about the hotel resort fees, which are extra to"
785,hotelriuplaza,"this hotel is a great find. it’s really well located; just one block from times square. (just make sure you get to the right one; the rid has two locations near times square). the staff were friendly at check-in, and the room - on the with floor - was awesome; modern, well designed and clean. the breakfast buffets, included in the price of my package, was very substantial; plenty of choice. there were sometimes lines to get into the buffets but if you came early or towards the end of service it wasn’t a major problem. all the staff i came in to contact with were great. i would definitely return to this property, and would recommend to anyone visiting the city"
786,hotelriuplaza,"my first trip to ny and traveling as a lone female i wanted to feel safe. the hotel is everything i wanted and more, it is right in the city near to shops and restaurant but away from all the non. broadway is on your footstep so you have to see a show! i went bed and breakfast - so much choice, all wonderfully laid out. my room was lovely providing peace and tranquility at the end of a busy day. for me though it was the staff who gave real heart to this hotel. they welcome you with open arms and truly have the greatest patience when dealing with difficult guests (and some were very difficult!). thank you rid place for making my adventure to new york such a special one."
787,hotelriuplaza,"unconscionable mandatory $88 “facility fee“ for which you get a couple of bottles of water (depending on the length of stay), grm access, & “free“ i-i, which can’t reasonably be considered an “extra” these days, + they force you to enter detailed demographics to access it, presumably so they can use/sell your mined data (it never function as that process was interrupted by a dropped signal); an insulting rip off which will make me avoid rid properties in the future. otherwise: new high-rise hotel with very slightly nicer/larger rooms than comparable hotels in times square. nice bedding, small desk, small area for clothes storage, full length mirror, mind fridge, safe. pretty nice bathroom with basic toiletries, magnified wall mirror, shower (no bath). no"
788,hotelriuplaza,"had the most amazing time at rid place, was here for 3 nights and everything was perfect. this was my third time visiting ny and this was definitely the best hotel that i have stayed at. it is so modern, fantastic rooms, staff are so friendly and the location is literally 1 block from times square. also when i returned home to northern ireland, i had discovered that i had left my god hair straightened in my hotel room, the hotel were amazing at getting them sent back to me. helena who works at customer service was fantastic at helping out with my collection and delivery with del. would recommend anyone to stay here for their ny trip!"
789,hotelriuplaza,john the receptions was amazing. he really took care of me start to finish. i would definitely visit again due to his amazing service. he made sure my needs were met and i got into my room as quick as possible. he also handled my check out and amazing yet again.
790,theadolphus,the pool decoration looks amazing and very festive. the hostess angela l was very helpful on answering every question i had. the drink they had was clever for the holidays. would totally recommend this place to my family and friends.
791,theadolphus,very beautiful hotel and extraordinary experience. jena and sydney are perfect at making the guest feel welcome and comfortable. from the time i checked in to the time i left these ladies made my first stay a phenomena adventure. i love this place i didn’t want to leave.
792,theadolphus,"sydney was very helpful and provided great customer service! she helped me through the check out process and was overall very nice. the hotel itself is great and location can’t be beat. service is phenomena and amenities are great (pool, fitness center)"
793,theadolphus,this was one of the best experiences. sydney was very helpful and pleasant. would recommend to anyone due to the superior customer service. i wanted a place with good vices and good people and i feel like i found the perfect place.
794,theadolphus,a beautiful hotel. the rooms are clean and well maintained.  everyone of the staff i came in contact with was very friendly. in  walking distance of everything i could possibly need. also a great restaurant called twisted troops.  was an amazing visit for the tony robin's event!
795,theadolphus,"i cannot recommend a stay at the adolphus enough! from the moment i entered the hotel, the staff ensued my stay was a perfect one. sydney at the front desk got me checked in, and all of the pullman were meticulous. the hotel offers a historic tour at 5 pm every day and dan gave a tour covering the historical touchstones which have shaped the adolphus into what it is today. for me, the best part is the alliance that comes from the historic lobby and the opulence french room. wood panelled walls, the detailed ""a"" in every iron grating, the king of bees chandelier all add to this. they don't make hotels like this anymore so when you are looking for a special stay, choose the adolphus!"
796,theadolphus,"was having a crisis and man at the sea was particularly helpful! the sea offers blowouts, make application and has a nice resting room you can hang out in if you have an appointment with the sea….."
797,theadolphus,from the moment i stepped in everyone was so friendly and helpful. a gentleman by the name of jay hauled all my huge heavy bags up to my room and set up my luggage rack!  dan the converge spent a lot of time with me pointing out where i could go for my own walking tour that included the of museum. he also made hotel reservations for me for friday and saturday night when everything was so busy. many many thanks!
798,theadolphus,"levi was absolutely amazing. i have never been to a bar with such an amazing bartender. her personality made my whole experience worth it. she paid attention to detail and made sure not only i but everyone at the bar was taken care of! everyone please if you go to this lobby bar, make sure levi is working for the greatest experience yet! love her!"
799,theadolphus,"the experience was excellent, i would recommend this barber. line was great, she makes great conversation and gives you recommendations for your hair with her expertise. she can count me in as a regular."
800,swissotel,"from check in to check out nothing but great customer service. the room was clean, we had an excellent view, pillows were clean soft and fluffy. bed was comfortable and relaxing. i can go on and come. definitely worth every penny. we had a sang with the shower/heating and within minutes, maintenance was in the room and fixed the problem. management mrs. pearl was great with assisting. very kind, professional and warm. i ordered room service, food was hot and came pretty quick. the young lady in valet (urica) was great and very professional and greeted me and my spouse with a smile. i definitely recommend staying at this hotel and i’m positive i’ll be returning   again the customer service was top tier, which means a lot to me"

804,swissotel,"first trip to chicago and i had the luck to choose this hotel. the location and views are phenomena, the staff was amazingly helpful, and the unique triangle shape makes it pop in a city full of amazing buildings. the prices were very unfordable as well. highly recommend to all."
805,swissotel,"daisy was so kind, was very helpful during the whole check in process. she provided us with all the information we need and was also able to answer all the questions we had. she had also sent a complimentary bottles to our room to enjoy the super bowl."
806,swissotel,"one of the best hotels in chicago! this is our go-to hotel when we need a weekend gateway. beautiful views, space rooms, comfortable beds, and friendly workers! larry from valet is always so pleasing, polite, friendly, and amazing to deal with! we have stayed several times and he has always provided the best valet."
807,swissotel,"a lovely hotel on the chicago river. the with floor provided massive views on the ice packs on the chicago river. easy reception.  6 elevators allowed multiple option and quick elevation to our room. the room was clean, however the bathroom was minuscule. the added-on shower was enveloped by two corner walls and 2 safety-glass rampart. the surface was 9 square feet and humans couldn’t move in the space without opening the glass door. the shower water was great, with force and heat. need hooks on the wall and space to place toiletries. the hidden, (cheap corporate) hoax was on check-out. we were charged a urban amnesty fee of $25.00 per night. senseless, because daytime temperature in chi-town was in the mid-10’s.  who in god’s name steps out to that “urban”?"
808,swissotel,me and my husband stayed here for a conference he had and the housekeeper daniel came to service my room and taught me how to make the bed like they do because i tried to make it like that and my husband told me that’s now how it looked when we checked in ll daniel was very helpful when i asked her to help me learn how to make the bed we had a wonderful conversation i just want to say thank you daniel you were great !

810,thebryantparkhotel,"had the most wonderful stay at the bryant park hotel. we were warmly welcomed by to at the front desk upon checking and every staff member was so helpful and accommodation. our room was spacious (especially for ny!) and beautifully furnished with the most spectacular view of bryant park. my husband and i loved having a glass of wine while looking out over the ice stating risk. the bed was very comfortable and we really appreciated the little touches such as a sound machine in our room and the luxurious often brown toiletries. the location was so perfect for everything we needed to do. just a quick walk to the museum of modern art, central park and plenty of shopping and restaurant. you’re even incredibly close to time square/rockefeller center (less than a 5 min walk) but just"
811,thebryantparkhotel,the hotel is located right at the heart of th ave at 40 st which s perfect for all major attractions. the staff were friendly and the room was spacious and clean. a special mention to to on reception who took time to discuss our plans and made us feel very welcome
812,thebryantparkhotel,"we had stayed at another hotel on bryant park before, i think it was the bryant park terrace. mistaken i thought the bryant park hotel was the same place but it’s a few peters away, conveniently and charmingly located right across from bryant park with its christmas decorations, winter village and ice stating risk of which we had a glorious view from our room. unfortunately some ugly scaffolding adorned the bryant park just now, spoiling the entry way. but the staff welcome was good and friendly and prompt when we arrived. i didn’t know the bryant park was #1 in new york on tripadvisor (i knew it was highly ranged) but i can see how it got its rating. slightly dated the elevators need some dating but they worked ok and our room was a very generously appointed suite with two"

814,thebryantparkhotel,"celebrating a limestone wedding anniversary, we chose the bryant park hotel for its ideal location, great service reputation, and the terrific reviews on tripadvisor.  it did not disappoint.  we booked the junior suite for the extra space, the views of bryant park, and the handsomely outfitted bathroom that included a deep soaking bathtubs.  large bathroom with tubs are a rarity in almost any hotel, and practically non-extent in new york.  thanks to all the front desk staff who provided exceptional service on our stay...with a special shout-out to josephine and john.  i wish i could mention everyone by name, as your attention and kindness was displayed consistently by everyone.  and lastly... thank you for not counting the number of front desk jersey kisses i snarled up"
815,thebryantparkhotel,we had never stayed at the bryant park hotel before and chose to because it had great reviews and was within walking distance from grand central terminal - what a great hotel.  cannon checked us in and she was so welcoming and accommodation to our needs (having just carried our bags from get) and took the time to further explain hotel services while walking us to our elevator.  our room was a modern well-appointed corner unit with views of bryant park and the bathroom was luxurious and incredibly spacious.  the location of this hotel is truly incredible.  we had left dinner reservations to the last minute so i asked verona at the check-in desk for some advice. she kindly offered to check with the restaurant adjacent to the hotel (roi) to see if a table was available and

818,thebryantparkhotel,"so just to start by saying, one of the best experiences i ever had in my life . from accommodations to comfort to all in all service. my vision for a wonderful night out with my new fiance was put together beyond expected by the team at bryant park hotel .. christopher monica went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable. the views of the bryant park state risk and lights gave us warm feeling like it was my own home . the bed super comfortable, warm and gorgeous room , mind bar stocked with everything you  need to have a copy night in, when i say attention to detail bryant park hotel definitely knows how to do it . upon entrance my bag was taken for me and carried to the room for me .service 100000 percent top notch .. definitely recommend everyone stay there number 1"
819,thebryantparkhotel,"what an amazing trip we had. this trip was my partners dream christmas location and it turned out to be her very own fairytale of new york.   the hotel is absolutely amazing, whether it be the staff, location or even a nice hot bath after a long day walking round the cold city - bryant park hotel had it all. the suite with a bryant park view was especially nice!!   i want to say a huge special thank you to kieran bennett who helped bring my dreams to life! i had been speaking to kieran for a few weeks prior to flying out as i’d planned to propose to my partner. i’d given him an idea of what i wanted but couldn’t be more grateful for how he brought it to life!! she said yes & i just wish i could have thanked him in person!   you’ll not regret staying here!"
820,thebryantparkhotel,"woman’s hospitality was phenomena, very professional, and gave a very detailed tormented explanation of every menu option. he does a great job managing the team of serves and bartenders. everyone was very pleasant, i will be returning with my friends and family to this beautiful venue."
821,thebryantparkhotel,"this was my and time and i'd definitely go back 10.000 more times to that hotel- it's a boutique feeling in the middle of chronic traffic of manhattan- most of hotels i've been to in the city are noisy- this was so different, and so much better that decided to go back. story gets better when my room was cold and the treat i received + the change of the room was org, out of this world and the team behind it absolutely outstanding- i'd recommend this 100.000 times ah forgot to share, how much i seize with dust, this hotel has no carpets in the room (apart from a small one on the central table) my clergy is 0 when i'm there!! staff are phenomena and they deserve all the good stuff in this world!!"
822,thebryantparkhotel,rate excellent because:  1. team were very friendly and accommodation and made a point to actually engage in conversation and learn my name.   2. spacious and quiet room with large bath - had both a shower and separate tub.     well appointed and clean.   thoughtful details like white noise machine and earplugs although i didn’t need them.  3. great bar and restaurant.   4. properly equipped fitness center  5. convenient location.   6. clean.   7.  complimentary puffing and coffee in morning.
823,thebryantparkhotel,"born and bred in ny — to say my expectations are high would be an understatement. to at bah doesn’t disappoint. from the moment you walk in, to greet you with a warm welcome and always has your best interest in mind. make sure you ask her to share her tin whistle stories :)."
824,thebryantparkhotel,i have been going to ny for years with work and have stayed all over in different hotels. i dont post many reviews but felt compelled to do so after staying at the bryant park hotel. the hotel was excellent and the service was absolutely outstanding. i ran ahead before booking to ask a few questions and to was just amazing from the first moment. siobhan also when i arrived ( to was away until the last day and was wonderful and so friendly and helpful even when i had already checked out!). if you want to differentiate yourself as hotel on friendliness and service this is the way to do it. the hotel is a great location and the rooms were spotless. they are upbraiding rooms at the moment so it will be interesting to see those when completed. price / value its a non trainer and such
825,thebryantparkhotel,"i had the special privilege of getting to stay in one of the newly renovated suites. there will be more of those to come soon as i was told. it was the best hotel room i've seen in all of new york city. it was so inviting, serene, relaxing, and notably large (it was the largest type they have, with a separate room for the living/dining space). the front desk staff made sure to ask me at check in to provide them with my feedback and then they were sincerely interest in my perspective as i checked out. to was especially friendly and helpful upon check out. other notable things about this hotel: the staff are all very helpful, the location is excellent, the elevators are fast, and the coffee in the morning is strong."
826,thebryantparkhotel,"stayed at the bryant park hotel for a business trip. the location was perfect and central to the business area. josephine was brilliant on reception and no ask was too much.  the rooms were nice, big and modern and the bathroom offered separate bath and shower which all look quite new."
827,thebryantparkhotel,"great hotel, perfect location, amazing restaurant and services.  very helpful staff !   i booked around 20 room for business. everything was great.   from the booking to the checkout, everyone was very helpful. all our need were met.  we had a great time!"
828,thebryantparkhotel,great hotel - fabulous location and very warm and welcoming staff. to kinsella and the team  were super helpful and went above and beyond!  lovely rooms with a view of the bryant park christmas market. would absolutely stay here again when visiting new york.
829,thebryantparkhotel,"with all of the tresses and challenges that travelling brings, it's great to find a property that helps relieve the stress and exceeds expectations.  the bryant parts location is top notch, staff is sincere and very attentive, and property is elegant.  thanks all your kindness to at front desk and dominion at bell stand., wonderful to chat with you."
830,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"stay at the heart regency dallas from the 19/11/23 to 23/11/23. now what an experience i could not fault the hotel one bit. the room was amazing and comfortable,all staff were amazing i had an issue with my credit-card and they could do enough to get the issue resolved for m. went out to dallas for the with anniversary for of what an experience that was and the hotel helped make that for me as well…. thank heart regency dallas 🇺🇸🇺🇸"
831,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"stylish design with no practical value. you cannot watch the to sitting in any of the chairs nor from the bed given it's placement. one small power block containing 3 low average sockets and 2 us ports and one double wall socket on the far corner are the only readable option. but all well maintained with less wear than you expect in a chain hotel. it's also sad that the walls are less soundproof than you'd hope and the ""quiet time from pm"" is enforced by the honor system rather than action. when 3 tears of teenager are staying overnight for a sports tournament."
832,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"very impressed by this heart.  to be honest, i was a bit skeptically it would be dated, however i was wrong.  high floor city view room was very spacious, modern, and clean.  i appreciated the longer next to the window.  as noted in other reviews, you will hear train noise on the city view side.    breakfast buffets and service at the bar were both excellent.  the only negative service i encountered was the passive nature of the front desk team at check in.    i walked downtown and to the of museum and felt completely safe in the daytime."
833,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"i give this stay a b- overall. the building itself is ironic, and it’s fun to roam around and read the various newspaper clipping and fun facts, along with an elevator ride to the top floor and down. the room was spacious and updated, but i could hear the people in the room next door. then i went to the pool. it is tiny and dated. what really drags my rating down is that the next day during a rain, a window washed appeared announced at 8:am. tired from a long flight, i had hoped to sleep in and not be awoke by what sounded like a horrified crime from his tables banging against my window. when i mentioned this at check out, i was aghast when the staff chuckled and said they never know the window washed is going to show up, and therefore can’t worn guests. overall i’d"
834,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,this is my third time staying at reunion and it’s been generally good. today however ar from the valet added an extra touch to make it great. all she did was just have a small conversation while my bags was being loaded. even though it i was small it made a difference. shout out to ar!
835,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,the best part is this hotel has a great bar downstairs that is a nonstop party until am.   the worst part is this hotel has a great bar downstairs that is a nonstop party until am and i could hear all of the noise very clearly in my room on the ninth floor.   if you’re looking for a middle-aged woman with green eyes and long blonde hair who isn’t wearing underwear this is a great spot.   if you’re looking for a relaxing place to sleep find somewhere else to stay.
836,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,dixon was great on arrival he made me feel welcomed and was amazing 10 stars. i was in town for business and he made that part of the trip smooth very unapproachable individual extremely reliable and daring of my schedule and time.
837,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"“4 reasons why you should stay away from this hotel at all costs”  i stayed at the heart this last weekend and i can honesty say. “stay away from this hotel at all costs”.   	1.	security needs to be addressed. i marked in the self parking at 17$ a night.  its not a big deal and if i am staying for an extended period of time i tend to park at self parking. this morning i walked down the hill to the separate parking lot and noticed my tailgate to a f250 platino was stolen. the thieves managed to break apart of the side fence and lift the tailgate off the back and through the fence next to the main road. there are camera pointed in the direction but i couldn’t get access to the video feed unless i filled out a police report, and then they would let me look at the tapes. all i"
838,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"stayed here for a week. woman broke into my hotel room one morning. i was in the shower and i heard someone walk into my room. the woman had a key to my room ( i had both keys accounted for). she walked in while i was exposed and started asking me questions. i yelled at her to leave. she walked out, security camera up, and the woman came back. they caught her but let her run away. never stay here, if i was not in my room, she could have taken everything i had and got away with it. the train noise was ridiculous throughout the night a trains gone would bare and it would sound like it was in the room."
839,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,stopped to get some rest on the way back to dallas from las began  and it was a great choice clean and room and breakfast was also great i will be stopping there to rest once again when i make the trip back threw
840,hollywoodhotel,amazing stay at the hotel tonight. room was big enough for my family. thanks to oil we came in and out with no problem. unfortunately it was a hospital visit so we didn’t have any time to explore but we will be back next time to enjoy the things that are included with the room.
841,hollywoodhotel,wonderful hotel! daniel at front desk was very accommodation and hospitality. he made the environment welcoming and was fast at checking us in. we had previously for our honeymoon and decided to return again. we will gladly come back in the future!
842,hollywoodhotel,came from up north and oil checked us in with no problem. we checked in to room 234 and it was great. very clean room and spacious. as a family traveler i can say we felt safe inside the hotel even though outside is a little shake. for family’s i will still recommend.
843,hollywoodhotel,"it is excellent hotel, i like because the person who is in the reception it is excellent men that's why i give him five star, so i and also the place is very good the room is very clean and i the feature i will come here"
844,hollywoodhotel,"such a cut spot! the rooms were copy and clean with a balcony overlooking the very pretty courtyard. convenient and historical location, right on the transit and rail line to get anywhere in la for cheap. we walked most places, next to amazing street food, restaurant, coffee, bars, shops and parts. just a short drive from griffiths park (we walked, probably wouldn't recommend it, but we saw owns)! we loved out stay, daniel and the rest of the staff were so nice and helpful when checking in and out!  definitely recommend!"
845,hollywoodhotel,hotel was nice and come. daniel at the front desk was great as he was very kind and even upgrade our room for free for my sister's birthday. the room was cut and nicely decorated. would definitely recommend!
846,hollywoodhotel,"we arrived at property and checked in, all the reviews saying staff are helpful is rubbish, the lady on reception never even cracked a smile and gave us our key and couldn’t even be gathered to explain where lift was or room! the room is basic, but dated, don’t bother laying in the bath as you need to keep getting up to use shampoo etc and to put more water in.. the road outside is very loud and busy. the air conditioning comes on at 3 am and sounds like someone has left a bag of spanned’s in the tumble dwyer. there is no bar or restaurant and hasn’t been since before could. you wouldn’t want to go outside in the dark, not a good area, you need to get taxi’s everywhere. the picture of the hotel front door is around the back and not the one you use… all in all wouldn’t recommend"
847,hollywoodhotel,"from the moment we arrived and throughout the rest of our stay, daniel, claude and the rest of the team were extremely helpful and friendly. the grm and anna were a really nice touch, as was the garden in the center. the hotel is in a great location, a little off of the action on hollywood bled, which is probably a good thing!"
848,hollywoodhotel,bryan was the gentleman who checked us in. he  was very rude and condescending. the room wasn’t at all what the photo look like. the rooms look like they haven’t been upgrade for many years. they also overcharged us for the parking.
849,hollywoodhotel,"the best kept secret in hollywood!!! class, charming, elegant and convenient!!! it’s like staying at the every hills hotel, but for a fragment!!! my family and i loved it and the staff, managers, the pool, even has a anna! simply superb and special thanks to jose r and david, they went out of their way to accommodate! search no further!!!"
850,silversmithhotel,"location was perfect. in the loop and right by the “l”. we heard no train noise. our room was spotless, bed wonderfully comfortable. breakfast was not so great. every at the front desk straightened that out and provided great advice on a number of other things, going so far as running out in the rain the next morning to suggest a different breakfast spot. three cheers for every!"
851,silversmithhotel,"nice location in the loop.  it is close to the train, the parts, and the museums.  the staff were friendly and responsive to our requests. the room was large, the bed was comfortable, and the shower had great water pressure, in other words perfect for a long weekend away. we will stay here again."
852,silversmithhotel,"my wife and i booked this hotel for labor day weekend and it’s very convenient for getting around chicago. it’s right next to an el stop and from midway you’re dropped right at the hotel. the staff are attentive and follow up. just be aware that there’s an expensive ($30/day) “preservation fee”, which covers water, wife and housekeeping. so if you take out what every other hotel does, it’s $30/day for water. we didn’t learn of this fee until after we booked too, which is frustration. the friendly and helpful staff made up for it, but definitely is something you should be aware of when booking here. i wish they’d have just added the cost up front. overall, a very good experience though and we were happy that despite being so close to the el, we couldn’t hear it from our room."
853,silversmithhotel,"a lovely, art deck, hotel ideally situated for exploring downtown chicago and the lake front.  we stayed for 4 nights and we were really pleased with our room. the staff were very friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. they booked our architecture river ride and got us a discount. lots of places to eat and drink very nearby.  we would definitely stay here again.  hint - try to get a room with an external view for more natural light"
854,silversmithhotel,"this hotel is in the perfect location-close to millennium park, the art institute, major stores and many outstanding restaurant. the extremely comfortable bed, quiet room, and attention to detail make the room experience superior. the staff are friendly and professional. this is our third visit to the silversmith and each one has been perfect. we will return!"
855,silversmithhotel,the front desk staff are fabulous and so friendly and helpful. loved all the staff actually. the room was huge and clean. love it. the location is amazing. a 10 min walk from tramp tower and a 5 min walk from faces. really close to a target store and retro stations. there is a great coffee shop opposite called goddess coffee.
856,silversmithhotel,"the silversmith is an unobtrusive hotel.  it’s possible to walk past and barely notice it.  but, if you step inside, you’ll find yourself in a tastefully-decorated lobby with lots of marble.  more importantly, you’ll also find yourself interesting with an extremely friendly and helpful staff - people who will go out of their way to make your stay a pleasant one!  this was our second visit to the silversmith and each time we found our room to be pleasant, comfortable and quiet.  i’d like to give a particular shout-out to staff-member unique who was especially helpful with storing our bags and getting us a taxi - he’s a very nice guy!  if you’re looking for a nice place to stay in the loop, i recommend the silversmith!"
857,silversmithhotel,"i'm not the kind of person who leaves a review after each stay, but i have to do so for the silversmith hotel. like others have said, it is a true gem. while the hotel is extremely clean and is in a beautiful, historic building, it is the staff that made our stay perfect. they were so friendly and would take the time to help us with directions, finding a taxi, or just advice about the city. make sure you ask about the architecture river cruise, as they can get you dismounted tickets."
858,silversmithhotel,"i don't usually leave reviews but felt i should for this great place to stay. first visit to chicago so it is always a pain trying to nail down the best place to stay. the silversmith has a great location within the city and is close to many attractions. the room was very clean and well kept. the staff was super helpful and nice. finally, great alliance within the city that had that chicago feel. can't recommend this place enough."
859,silversmithhotel,"the silversmith far exceeded our expectations. this was an unfordable hotel in a great location- i thought it would be adequate. it was fabulous. the staff were so friendly and helpful, the restaurant served a delicious breakfast, and the room was clean and well appointed."
860,virginhotels,"we went to miss rocky’s for dinner and drinks on a weekend evening. the food was great, fantastic atmosphere, but the service was the best part. tony, our server, was one of the best i’ve ever had. going back for sure. he made the whole experience"
861,virginhotels,"we had a wonderful weekend at virgin hotels chicago. had was so helpful, getting us checked in, upbraiding our room and there for any questions during our stay! everyone was so friendly and welcoming. we enjoyed the coffee shop, restaurant and roof top bar. great location for exploring, but also comfortable room with beautiful views when staying in, we will certainly return!"
862,virginhotels,"loved staying here! friends and i went to circle du soil and decided to stay overnight.. the service was amazing, every employee was so personal and helpful.   we had breakfast at miss rocky’s and our server else was great! she was so attentive and nice and brought our food out so fast! will definitely be back again!"

867,virginhotels,"i want to thank james g, dandy m and train j and the whole team at the virgin for making our trip to chicago the trip of a lifetime. we had booked a suite with a river view, but upon arrival it turned out there had been a mix up and all of the suites with a river view had already been allocate. we love chicago and had very much been excited for staying in a cool room with a view of one of our favourite downtowns.  upon seeing our disappointment, the team at the virgin upgrade us to the rockstar ""richard brandon suite"" which was beyond our wildest dreams. an incredibly sick and lavish interior design with epic views of the river and chicago from all angles. this upgrade was one of the most unexpected and decent gestures we have ever received and made our weekend in chicago"
868,virginhotels,"we absolutely love the virgin hotel chicago! this year we have stayed at this property 3 times. the location is perfect and close to so many fun things! the property is impeccably clean, the staff is so friendly! we are part of rewards program ""the know"" and we have an amazing person named eliza that not only has assisted with getting us upgrade, but also sent champagne to our room! she's so attentive and helpful! i can't say enough wonderful things about virgin hotel chicago!!! we will never stay anywhere else when visiting!"
870,swissotel,"as a seasoned traveler, i understand that occasional hiccups can happen during hotel stays. however, my recent experience at swissotel in chicago has compelled me to share a cautionary tale about resolved filling issues that have left me both frustrated and disappointed.  during my stay, i encountered an inexplicable filling error - valet charges added to my bill, despite the fact that i did not use a car during my visit. what followed was a month-long ordeal of trying to get this issue resolved, which included: 	•	multiple calls to the front desk: despite several calls and two messages left for the accounting department, there was a complete lack of response. 	•	unfulfilled promises: a conversation with a staff member, kit, led to a promise of a return call that never"
871,swissotel,"needed to take a minute to acknowledge an outstanding employee, lashondra jones!  i was presenting at a conference being held at the hotel and was given instructions to use the valet service which would expeditiously take my car.  unfortunately, the valet was already full and ms. jones explained the safety concern and fire code rules.  while i completely understood, i still did not have a place to park and was frustrated.  ms. jones was so polite and understanding and even joked a little about the day which immediately calmed my frustration.  she could have continued to turn me away, but instead she figured out a way to secure my car on the property so that i could get to my presentation to 100+ attended.  i cannot thank ms. jones enough and believe you have a truly dedicated"
872,swissotel,great hotel and wonderful help from all the staff.  i would especially like to thank celtic with the valet for all of his assistance when we were leaving.  he did a great job of keeping us informed of the status of our car and helped us get on our way.
873,swissotel,"stay was overall wonderful, great staff, and clean room/hotel not to mention a nice surprise of a christmas tree in our room!! valet celtic was very polite and nice to talk to. the only concern i had during the stay was when we left for dinner someone had entered our room and left 6 chairs even through we didn't ask for them. it took up a lot of space and we had our belongings out; luckily nothing was missing and we placed the chairs in hall to be picked up. again, over all great stay and we will be back."
874,swissotel,all staff was friendly. celtic the valet was great. pp didn't work for testing valet to get our car so that part caused a longer wait. rooms were clean. maid staff very good. we will stay there again

878,swissotel,"in town for a conference for 4 days and had light meals a couple of times.  our bartender, bolivia, assisted us several times for drinks and meals.  she was always cordial, prompt.  our last evening, we dropped by for a light repast and drinks, inadvertently leaving our bag.  bolivia was incredibly helpful to assure our purchases were returned to us.  a happy ending, and a delightful stay!"
879,swissotel,"room was dirty and nothing worked. if it want for the conference i attended i would have stayed anywhere else. i will say, it was a great location to walk around the city. but i never felt relaxed in my room"
880,hiltonuniversalcity,"the first time we stayed at this hotel, it was the bell service and valet that left a good impression.    this time around, it was i think maria? at guest services who i spoke with over the phone day before arrival.  i requested for balloons, upon check in, they not only prepared balloons, but had a piece of cake waiting in the room.  thank you so much, it was well appreciated.  during this stay, christian has also been wonderful in answering all our inquiries.  she is knowledgeable, warm and friendly.  it was such a pleasure being assisted by her.  thank you christian.  hope you had a nice birthday though you are working.   the room is spacious, clean except window hills.  plenty of elevators, but are all so slow.  scuttle service run every 15 minutes.  the location is really a"

882,hiltonuniversalcity,"the reception staff, christian, was friendly, courteous, and extremely professional. she greeted me with a warm welcome, and her efficiency in handling check-in procedures was remarkable. additional, christian was attentive to my requests and provided helpful information about the hotel amenities and local area."
883,hiltonuniversalcity,"universal hilton took great care of us, essaying back promptly when i made a request through the hilton pp.  jerome g and havana were both prompt, thoughtful, and professional, personalizing our stay. we will certainly be back, and bring more family next time."
884,hiltonuniversalcity,we stayed for two nights. the room was spacious and clean. the view out the window was fantastic. the bed was very comfortable. christian at the front desk was courteous and answered all of our questions. would definitely recommend friends to stay!
885,hiltonuniversalcity,"had the best experience.  great hotel, impeccably clean, very comfortable.  would have liked breakfast included.  awesome buffets breakfast, also breakfast from the menu. starbucks inside the hotel was a home run!  hotel shop has everything you could ever need during your trip. room service was the best!!  hotel is so close to universal city, secure walking distance, very good pedestrian signal.  universal studies shutters come and go often, and citysightseeing hop on hop off blue route comes right to the hotel lobby, which is very convenient.  friendly staff all over the hotel, specially christian at the front desk, who checked us in and gave the best tips, also helped us greatly with a misha on our returning scuttle to the airport. thank u, christian!!"
886,hiltonuniversalcity,"breakfast buffets is amazing! rosendo made it simply perfect! all three mornings we were able to sit in his section.  never had an empty coffee, or empty diet come.  best service ever! thanks again rosendo! you won’t be disappointed in the service!"

888,hiltonuniversalcity,"stayed for 3 evenings , had 2 evening meals and 3 all were lovely with great service. must mention christian on reception who is a star. on checking in i left my money wallet on reception.christian found and gave to security. after 1 hour i went down and got my money ."
889,hiltonuniversalcity,the staff is great! room and amenities are kept clean everyday. will definitely stay here again! super close to universal studies and they also have a scuttle! this was very beneficial during the rain! the breakfast buffets was a hit as well!
890,theplaza,"the hotel has a good location, is clean and has a great history. and there is the odd staff member, like vinesse (front desk) and paul (luggage) who tried. other than that - zero service!   our welcome was equal to a 2 star hotel. we were not made to feel welcome (but at the same time, the front desk person was not rude) and i'm pretty sure in the 3 days i didn't get a smile, a 'hello' or a 'can i help you'. nothing.  i've stayed in suites before that offer butler. they normally greet you and check in on a regular basis if there's anything needed. i even feel awkward and decline when they kindly offer to pack or unpack for you.  we didn't even see the butler that was advertised and at $1250 a night i expected more if i'm honest.  the room was a good size. quiet but zero view."
891,theplaza,delighted to share that my stay at the place hotel was exceptional! the suite was not only beautiful but also spacious and incredibly comfortable. a perfect blend of luxury and comfort for a memorable experience. highly recommended! would love to be back soon!
892,theplaza,"our christmas trip to ny was highlight by high tea at the place! fabric, our waiter, gave us excellent service and added to the opulence experience. the patisserie were unique- each one a flavor combination with beautiful presentation.  the atmosphere was festive with sparkling christmas trees.  reserve in advance."
893,theplaza,"a great hotel. however, their champagne bar for breakfast was a huge disappointment. state if art room. great bathroom. great restaurant. i loved the absence; the entrance is like a museum. however, the her people sometimes have a wrong attitude… a but of robbery."
894,theplaza,"the palm court tea at the place is prices but very worth it. it's absolutely lovely location and the transition in the evening makes it more magical. the tea was fragrant and delicious. my partner is coeliac and they were incredibly attentive, never felt rushed, and the lumen free food was taste with variety.  the service was implacable. warm without being intrusion, friendly, attentive, and an absolute delight. ask for far tell to attend your table.  100 stars for him.   i am definitely coming back and bringing my friends here."
895,theplaza,amazing tea! the service was extraordinary (ask for far- the kindest and most welcoming server i've ever had!) the lumen free tea was amazing and i didn't feel like i was missing out on anything even though my partner had regular tea!
896,theplaza,"let me preface this by saying that i think everyone should experience the place if they can. however, i’m glad i had hotel points for this stay and did not use my own money. it would not have been worth it. the room was luxurious, and the butler/housekeeping service was excellent, but there were a lot of things wrong with our stay. first off, we had to check in late. they didn’t have our room ready on time, which was disappointing. second, the room service (mind you for 2 people cost upwards of $120 for one meal) was served cold. it was not up to par with the food that i thought would be served. third, when we left, i was not given my full deposit back. i was told when i called to verify that i was being charged for a meal that we did not order. all in all, it’s a nice hotel"
897,theplaza,"the stay was very nice but the things mentioned below were disappointing for the price we paid we called down for bellhop at approximately 11:am  wanted arrived and brought our bags down. we never received a ticket for baggage claim  we checked out gave in our parking ticket at approximately 12:15, took a brief walk in the park and came back. our vehicle wasn’t pulled up yet so trick style was called down to assist.  after 15 minutes she helped us get our own bags and we walked them outside to the curb even then helped us and said our vehicle was on the corner of with in which is was not  he proceeded to walk us to the garage where the cars were marked. even called someone and it was then reported our car was now in front of the hotel  even was of great assistance and"
898,theplaza,"excellent afternoon tea with delicious sandwiched, cakes etc. our waiter, maman was very pleasant and helpful.       i asked for mint tea rather than earl grey but was told that it wasn’t available. unusual not to be offended a choice."
899,theplaza,"superb hotel , amazing staff and wonderful food. cannot wait to return. picked all the boxes. so close to all the major amenities inner. loved the fresh smell of flowers in the hotel for. beds were very comfortable. cannot wait to return!!"
900,sheratongrand,"buds & first class service from media (district restaurant). truly warm and welcoming service during our visit. very accommodation and always provide service with a smile. we appreciate your “can do” attitude. thank you. overall, the hotel is clean and location is good. not much happening over in downtown los angeles."
901,sheratongrand,"this is what the convoy experience is all about! came in town for the weekend for a concert at staples with a couple of friends. room was ready at check in, valet was convenient considering the location. if your not willing to pay the 50 some bucks for valet you’ll end up paying almost the same for daily parking at a lot. room was clean, well appointed and our view was decent. 2 things that could have been improved- the windows needed a wash on the exterior and we could have used more towels initially. these are minuscule issues that didn’t effect our stay at all. the lobby is gorgeous and the adjacent shopping center is so convenient for last minute shopping or a quick coffee run. the elevators were a bit tricky to work with your key but the added level of security it provides"
902,sheratongrand,"the sheraton grand is in a great location in fabulous downtown los angeles. i chose this hotel because it's only 2 miles away from the los angeles memorial colosseum. my friend and i were in town to rock out to rammstein. my first impressions of the hotel were that it's stunning and in a really great location near many different shops, restaurant and historic buildings. our room was really nice and had a great view from the with floor. the third floor has a really beautiful deck with cubans and seats to lounge/chill in. if you want to see some extra skyline views, go up to the very top floor in the fitness center. you'll be impressed! i think my only negative review is the lack of direction with how to use the elevator. i eventually got the hang, of it but i feel like the up"
903,sheratongrand,"the sheraton grand los angeles was a mixed bag for me. there was a lot of confusion pre check in, but michel made everything very easy for us and took great care when we finally arrived. the area immediately surrounding is a bit rough depending on which direction you go, but the hotel is walking distance to plenty of attractions, including the los angeles convention center, which is why i chose to stay there. also, the first hotel beds to not make my back hurt if that something you struggle with too. all in all, this hotel looked and performed at the price point, i plan to stay here again"
904,sheratongrand,"this hotel is well located in downtown la, very close to shopping and public transportation. the hotel’s door is a bit dated, but very well maintained. the room was clean and reasonably well-appointed. the service exceeded expectations, especially the valet-pullman combination, who seemed to really understand what hospitality is all about. i stayed with friends for two nights and would definitely stay here again when in la."
905,sheratongrand,"one word to describe this hotel - disgusting.   when we found hair on the towels, we just asked for fresh towels. then, we walked into find balls on hair on the shower walls. long, black hair just dried up and up on the walls. this bathroom had never been cleaned. toilet was also whipped and looked like there was dirt on it.   we got new rooms but were never able to shake the feeling of disgust. we decided to take shower at the next hotel. who knows what i’ll find this time?   sheraton grand is a category 6 hotel that has shining reviews on tripadvisor. i am extremely disappointed and will not be staying here or recommending it to anyone.   it’s conveniently located and the staff are generally attentive but this place is filthy. if you’re concerned about hygienic, this is not"
906,sheratongrand,"this hotel is generally located and very grand, but one employee made me feel very much at home.  minute saw i was lost and helped me back to my room, gave advice on restaurant, shopping, and even made me interested in working for sheraton!"
907,sheratongrand,"with floor lounge is the best and carolina was the most beautiful soul there, she gave the best tips to visit la and the nearby areas. why is this 200 words or more.... ahahah i need my time to review more"
908,sheratongrand,"we spent 2 days here prior to going on a cruise. the location is very much central with easy access to public transportation .  as a matter of fact the retro is right by this hotel. we had booked a club level room and the service on the club floor was excellent . both attendants were absolutely wonderful , especially carolina. she went out of her way to tell us how to use the transit system and which activities might be good for us to do. we followed her advice and had a wonderful day! thank you carolina!!"
909,sheratongrand,"the standard rooms are smaller in general. the suite rooms are big enough for 3 people. room service takes forever. the members lounge at the top floor offers scene views of the city and is pretty much in the downtown. the best part are the ratio roof top, and the location of the hotel. opens in the mall, has many option to walk around and order in. love the lounge at the first floor."
910,hoteledison,"the hotel is in a great location, right next to times square. they have two restaurant downstairs and a starbucks at the corner. the hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. my room was small, but it had all that i needed. if you need more space, i'd go with a different hotel such as hilton garden. thanks!"
911,hoteledison,great location. the rooms are small. not even little desk in some rooms. the bathroom is dated and the shower is a trifle. the restaurant are ok for food but very noisy at peak time. elevator ride can take some time especially at peak hours. allow a good min ...
912,hoteledison,"amazing experience at the hotel madison!!  highly recommend this hotel; have stayed here many many times over the years and always high quality stay, fantastic restaurant, clean environment, safe surroundings, and a staff that truly cares about the guests!"
913,hoteledison,"good luck getting sleep! the had unit turns on every min even when it’s shut off. metal on metal clanking every time it turns on. location of hotel is easy access to times square, subways, shopping and restaurant."
914,hoteledison,"beautiful old building, well maintained.  but internet proved inaccessible and the noise level from outside was very high well into the night.  i’d recommend the hotel overall, but for a 1 night business trip, it wasn’t ideal.  note also the so-called “facilities fee” that inflated the price by $45."
915,hoteledison,"in the heart of theaters, restaurant, and times square.  not the cheapest and not the newest, but a very helpful staff, great on-premise food and beverage, and clean, safe, and unfordable.  this trip was four nights and i met people from 5 countries, took 2 users and 4 cabs, and there was no part of the trip that was made harder by where i stayed.  consistent, good value, everything i need to do business and sleep and eat well."
916,hoteledison,"a nice hotel, in the heart of broadway at a great price.  can't beat that.  a short walk to times square, rockefeller center, all the broadway shows and great restaurant.   very nice staff, clean copy rooms."
917,hoteledison,"overall a good experience. beautiful art deck lobby, nice room, taste food in adjacent restaurant. great location in theatre district. complimentary wine hour on tuesday evening. helpful footmen. good option for breakfast."
918,hoteledison,you are not getting the service that you are paying for when you spend the night at this property. it's a very every-man-for-themselves midst at this hotel. do not expect to receive any kind of above and beyond hospitality experience.
919,hoteledison,"amazing location for tourist , but the hotel rooms are old. ours was missing a shower door which caused the bathroom to flood when used. if ordering packages, they charge per package. so for amazon type orders that come in bits, they will charge $8 per box/ item. the front desk staff are not friendly. they do give a personalised chocolate bar which is a nice welcome touch."
920,holidayinnexpress,"i usually always stay at the best western hotel on kendall drive when i come to mimi. but they had booked me in this holiday inn express & suites, and i can't lie i had the best service i ever received in hotels i stay. and i travel a lot and stay in different hotels i was checked in by this young lady by the name of athens and her college  lannes. but athens was checking me in with and explaining all but this hotel and went the extra mile to make me feel welcome at the hotel after i had just arrived and have fell at the mimi airport. and i was in a lot of pain. but she was very nice and professional. and to let them know if i need anything for the pain or a doctor to let them know..... she was very nice and helpful. and that's what i look for in the place (hotel) i like to"
921,holidayinnexpress,"i had the best time and marietta was amazing! she made sure i was taken care of every morning at breakfast, all with a smile. i also saw her assisting anyone else who had questions or needed anything extra. she went above & beyond! thanks so much, mary!"
922,holidayinnexpress,marietta deserves a raise $   she did a tremendous job making me feel like a welcomed guest. she increases the value of this holiday inn. i hope marietta gets the appreciation she deserves and is loved.
923,holidayinnexpress,"room is clean, tidy, and spacious (king she.). love seeing marietta every morning for break. she is always nice, positive, courteous, and nice while getting her work done especially when crowded. what a gem, she a keeper."
924,holidayinnexpress,"i have stayed x in this hotel. i like it because it's walking distance to a lot of stores, walk of fame, restaurant, etc.  the staff is very friendly and welcoming. mania at the front desk was very helpful all the time and when i had an issue with the phone in my room, they immediately sent a person to fix it. they made sure we had everything we needed.   breakfast is great and convenient. i highly recommend this place as it's not very expensive and the location is perfect. very clean."
925,holidayinnexpress,"great hotel!  perfect location, clean, secure and updated with modern amenities.  immediately being greeted by marietta in the breakfast area was a nice start to the day!  she was super attentive and engaged in the guest experience- an absolute pleasure ."
926,holidayinnexpress,"we had a great experience here. the place is clean but the best part of our stay was the staff! they were very friendly and went out of their ways to help/assist us. we travelled with 3 little kiss and our kiss wanted to go back there because of the hospitality and friendliness of the staff. i would make special mention marietta - she was super nice to our kiss every morning when we had our breakfast..seeing me with the 3 little ones (hobby had to leave for his conference), she would approach me and assist me and the kiss....we stayed there for almost a week and her treatment of us as guest left a mark with our kiss - they want to stay there again because ""marietta is super nice mamma"". thanks again for a wonderful stay!"
927,holidayinnexpress,marietta service was exceptional.. she caught my attention when i was at the breakfast room. she greeted every body good morning with a smile. her happy vices is contagious.. visit their breakfast room to witness it your self!
928,holidayinnexpress,"the best part of this hotel is its staff, especially in the breakfast room, but also at the front desk and valet station. yes, it’s a holiday inn express with its usual beds and breakfast, but the staff make all the difference—marietta and verona in the dining area plus the devoted people downstairs in the lobby area. i didn’t have many dealings with the cleaning staff while we were there, but they seemed pleasant. overall, the place has a good vice. the location is unbearable too—just a block from doubt theaters and hollywood bled. and about half a mile from the hollywood bowl. i would stay there again in a heartfelt."
929,holidayinnexpress,"i decided to stay at this hotel after reading a review from a x per week business traveler.  and that traveler was right.  i went for business, but brought my mon along so we could hang out on my off-days.  the hotel was clean and quiet, despite its heavily-trafficked location.  i was very impressed with the expensive breakfast choice (didn't realize it was an automatic pancake maker until after i was already gone...next time!).  the two ladies in charge of breakfast were friendly and willing to help in any way they could.  it was an easy 10-minute walk to the hollywood walk of fame through a couple of residential blocks.  there are two hotels immediately next door to this one and the reviews are not as good for either one as they are for this hotel.  while i had a slight"
930,thebryantparkhotel,we came by to colon and it was a busy day for them i guess. we were group of 7 people. their manager woman acknowledge us for struggling for seat and service than he helped us accommodate seating and took care of us for the rest of the night. the valentine day special drinks was a must try. great night!
931,thebryantparkhotel,"loved this hotel for ny.  great location right across from bryant park which has a state risk and christmas market.  close to everything but not right in the mix of times square or the busier/tourist areas.  close to grand central and the library.  our room was on a high floor and we were free upgrade to a sweet so we had a huge room with a living room, kitchenette and 2 baths for the price of a regular room.  the grm is small but great. the restaurant is good and the basement bar was very cool and great.  couldn't say enough about this hotel.  very cool exterior, staff were great.  totally recommend it."
932,thebryantparkhotel,"this hotel is just terrific. i can’t wait to return. the location is fabulous and the staff there are very friendly, accommodation and helpful. i loved the spacious and well appointed room and bath really top notch."
933,thebryantparkhotel,"we were just in ny and stayed at this hotel.  you could not be more generally located for the christmas markets and stating risk, the ny public library etc.  right in the heart of the city.  the staff were incredible and made our stay just so relaxing.  in particular, a big shout out to cannon at ""reception"".  she treated us like royalty and i'm sure that every guest walks away feeling the same.  thank you!"
934,thebryantparkhotel,"""the trip"" that is, two ladies and a gentleman in their eighties, approached new york with some trepidation albeit ""on the bucket list""!!!! pleased to say that siobhan the   manager, to and the front desk, plus the converge team at bryant park hotel , ensued that we need not have had any concerns as they were so friendly, helpful and made us feel ""one of the family"". the reservations for thanksgiving day, theatre, and restaurant were superb and helped to make our stay in new york unforgettable. the hotel is in fantastic situation for a tourist holiday - central for everything."
935,thebryantparkhotel,"bryant park hotel is in the best location for a holiday visit.  you can walk to everything including having the winter village right across the street!  the front desk staff made our birthday extra special with hand signed cards, balloon and a bottle of prosecco.  big shout out to josephine for being so nice and welcoming!"
936,thebryantparkhotel,i had the most amazing time at the bryant park hotel. the moment i walked into the lobby i was greeted by josephine and her colleagues. such warmth and professionalism . i had the an astonishing room with such a fabulous view overlooking bryant park and the winter markets chosen by verona. such a beautiful gesture by siobhan for the roses to compliment the amazing room. thank you to larry in housekeeping for ensuring everything was at hand. i would highly recommend you stay in the bryant park hotel  on your next visit to ny. ❤️ helen kilkenny ireland
937,thebryantparkhotel,"when i say i couldn't be happier with my 5 day stay at the bryant hotel, i really mean that. from 2 days before check in, they called to confirm my arrival time. they asked if we were celebrating anything special. once we checked in we had been upgrade.  the fabulous footman, dominion (know known as do, because we made friends) legged all our luggage up to our room. he had a great personality and gave us many recommendations for breakfast, lunch and dinners for the next 5 days. he also let us know his off days so in case we had questions he was available.  we then got a coupon from john c, at the front desk for a great bite to eat in the area. we then became familiar with all the staff and they'd call us by name. verona,  shaven, dominion,  john c, to ( i think that was her"
938,thebryantparkhotel,"i stayed over the weekend to celebrate my with birthday with family and friends.  the staff could not be friendliest!  they were accommodation and helpful with tips on places to visit etc..  the room had a bottle of champagne, with a birthday card signed by the staff.  so welcoming!  we had dinner at roi that friday evening and it was all that the reviews said it would be.  they held onto my luggage before and after i checked out so i could continue to enjoy the city.   shout out to domestic and the front desk crew!"
939,thebryantparkhotel,"two friends and i were there to celebrate our with birthdays and our stay could not have been better!  josephine, dominion and roman are the best! they were so friendly and made us feel like we were family! there was a bottle of campaign and balloons awaiting us, and an electric tea kettle was delivered immediately after asking.  josephine welcomed us and immediately knew we were the birthday girls.  she was like a friend whom we'd know all our lives.  dominion was so helpful in storing our luggage and suggesting a few good restaurant and calling for cabs when we left.  roman was very accomodating with everything we requested.  and the room was wonderful - clean, spacious comfortable beds.  we plan to return on our next visit to ny.  we would not think consider staying"
940,fairmontdallas,"hotel in a great location near upon. very kind and welcoming staff. valet gets cars in a timely fashion. however, it’s kind of old and in need of renovation. my room had a shower with a shower head extended arm attached to the shower head with pitiful low water pressure and barely warm water. there were green hard water stains on everything as well. the rooms barely had any outlets to charge devices. my hotel phone didn’t have a cord to the hand piece so i had to use the phone on speaker. and the hotel elevators are too small and too few. i spent at least 30 minutes a day waiting for elevators to come. overall, an ok stay but i won’t be seeking out this particular fairmont hotel again."
941,fairmontdallas,thank you philip for your kind assistance on thursday night. first evening in the states (from sa) and got lost on the way to my hotel. philip went out of his way to help and got me on my way. sorted. was
942,fairmontdallas,"tired hotel, inspired service, broken shower, no water pressure. bathroom sorely needed dating. poorly trained restaurant team. the hotel webster registration was painful. this one proud luxury hotel is now a third tier convention dive."
943,fairmontdallas,everything was very nice only thing is i did not have a fridge nor microwave in the room for my personal use i guess they want you to purchase food and drinks from them other than that very good service
944,fairmontdallas,"fairmont dallas, such an epic experience.  every single staff member is a delight.  attentive to every guest’s satisfaction.  showing genuine care, kindness, and service.  the rooms are beyond beautiful!  thank you so very much for your hard work, effort, time, and attention!  each and every single one of you is wonderful!  a special recognition to the wonderful front desk staff, and in-room dining attendants sulcus h. and brachio.  you are all truly and sincerely appreciated!"
945,fairmontdallas,very attentive staff! beautiful hotel. loved the whole experience. will definitely be looking for more of their locations for future stays. thank you to the converge who brought me my phone charge from my car to my room.
946,fairmontdallas,old. the portentous atmosphere that encapsulates the lobby soon ends as you reach your hotel floor & room. run quickly. parking is valet only with a $50 overnight. milder stench with outdated vices.
947,fairmontdallas,"i recently stayed at a hotel with a fantastic location, allowing us to walk everywhere. to my delight, the suite was spacious, offering a stunning view of the city.the converge and front desk team were remarkably friendly and information, i wholeheartedly recommend this hotel for its exceptional service and absence. i would definitely choose to stay here again."
948,fairmontdallas,"my experience at this hotel was very disappointing. the room was in need of maintenance and the heating was not sanctioning properly. there was no complementary water available and the space for luggage was inadequate. furthermore, the carpet was dirty and in need of cleaning. to make matters worse, there was only one employee at the front desk to handle a line of more than 10 people waiting to check-in. this is a clear indication of poor management. in my opinion, this hotel does not live up to the fairmont brand."
949,fairmontdallas,"room was really clean, very well presented. front desk was amazing. parking staff hit or miss depending who the valet is. waters in the shower didn’t stay hot long. almost like bird bathing. but overall amazing experience. bed super soft instantly went to sleep."
950,swissotel,beware of what they charged us at checkout called an urban fee.  if you are visiting from another country know that our president is trying to stop these kind of hidden taxes. if you stay there for a few days the charge comes to a hetty amount. not all hotels do this so just be aware. i looked at some of the poor comments from the past and there are similar messages. i won't comment further on the experience. we felt victimized .
951,swissotel,"we had a beautiful stay in the city for the it conference!  great stay at swissotel.  perfect ligation, even with a little rain during our architecture tour.  all staff were very helpful including celtic the valet...."
952,swissotel,"great hotel, would definitely book again. all staff were very professional and nice. celtic in valet was extremely helpful and kind!! i will definitely return to this hotel and recommend to others. the hotel had great views."
953,swissotel,do not waste your money - stay elsewhere. it's currently other in my room than outside chicago. everyone here is very polite and professional but they are probably working against c level eyes willingness to pay for upgrade. called to inform them my room was hot and humid. engineer came almost right away to assess. he confirmed the absent air was 72 degrees. there solution was to bring a fan into the room. he said the thermostat could not be turned down lower than 65. that does not make the room actually 65 because it sits directly below the vent. poor design because it's not getting an accurate reading of the actual room temperature just the air being blown out of the vent.   not happy paying 300 dollars a night to sleep in a sweat hot box.
954,swissotel,"the staff was amazing...especially celtic the valet.  he was fast, friendly and helpful.   my room was nice and clean.  i ate at the hotel several times and the food was delicious.  i recommend the smash burgher!  i loved the atmosphere in chicago and the ak representation.  i will be back!"
955,swissotel,"great staff! although we had one issue, our concern was quickly resolved.  hats off to craig cylinder, front office manager, celtic - an exceptional valet, and lashaond (s?) who helped us load our car.  thank you!!!!"
956,swissotel,the valet - celtic was very helpful - he was very cheerful and funny.  he made an ordinary experience that much better!   these tedious jobs can be done without a smile or done as a base job - with no excitement - celtic does his with enthusiasm and joy.  that made my day!
957,swissotel,"hotel was great, everything was very easy to get in and out of. the room was one of the cleanest hotel rooms i had ever seen. the valet worker we had, celtic, went above and beyond!! everyone would be lucky to have them valet their car."
958,swissotel,very clean. excellent staff! valet parking was so smooth. celtic our valet was kind and very helpful. extremely impressed with the attention to detail. come beds. the shampoo and conditioned are great quality.
959,swissotel,"hotel is clean, and the beds were come. celtic at the valet was fantastic, he is personal and prompt and made our stay that much more enjoyable. swissotel is so lucky to have a great employee like him!"
960,hollywoodhotel,"i don’t even know where to start or who is actually writing these good reviews about this place. i paid over $600 us to stay at the worst hotel i’ve seen, everything went wrong from the moment i arrived, the guy at the front was super rude to me and my family, but that’s not the worst. the whole place smells awful, the floor is so dirty, my room was disgusting and smelled terrible, you can’t control the ac in your room (apparently-that’s the answer i got from the receptions) and it is hot. the bed are like 50 years old and hard of, there is no “bar” or restaurant open, there is no complimentary breakfast and i feared for my life when someone knocked and tried to open the door in the middle of the night.😞"
961,hollywoodhotel,"daniel at the front desk did an excellent job getting us checked-in. he explained the details of our reservation, provided helpful into about the hotel facilities, was very efficient. he helped to create a present atmosphere for our stay."
962,hollywoodhotel,"2 rooms were utilised by our family during a 3 night stay.  the hotel rooms are in need of renovation as they are out dated, saying that the shower was ok but the towels were the size of hand towels in the up. i did have to keep asking for towels as they never seemed to be replaced?!  there was no natural light in our room due to the foliage growing outside the window of the court yard.  the sending machines didn’t work.  location isn’t great as there is no where valuable so we took user’s everywhere.  pool looked inviting but was freezing cold.  shops 5 mind away had a great dominions penza which was a godson.  starbucks was up the top of the road with surgeons and nurses lipping in from the opposite hospitals, they were dressed in all the regain including hair protectors!"
963,hollywoodhotel,"the location? not the best. the service? not the best. facilities? not the best. however the cleaner are where the worst of the worst is. rooms are dated and clearly aren’t cleaned well. i also left some cash under a jumper, very clearly not a tip, to which the cleaner helped themselves to. thieves. the hotel management did not seem to take this complaint very seriously.   i would avoid at all costs but if you have already booked to stay here, take your valuables with you. the safe costs money so either way you’re at a loss."
964,hollywoodhotel,the rooms were clean. beautiful pool area. restaurant is closed and apparently has been for a couple of years. so no option of any breakfast. they don’t offer free internet connection/wife and charged us us $5 per day for a single device only.  no coffee or tea in rooms although a coffee maker.
965,hollywoodhotel,"i don't understand the 5 star reviews on this site. they were incredibly misleading.  the hotel is in a terrible location and it is worn and dated throughout. we stayed for 2 nights and were afraid to walk around the neighbourhood.  we spent more money on users to get places than we saved staying at the hotel.  spend the money and stay at a nicer hotel in a better area.  we asked the night clerk at the front desk to arrange a pick-up for us in the morning to take us to the airport.  the cab ""company"" that he recommended only took cash. when we said we had to pay by credit card he said he couldn't help us.  that was extremely sketch behaviour and i've never stayed at a hotel that wouldn't arrange for an early morning ride for you.  one user driver said that he had heard that the"
966,hollywoodhotel,"clean, quiet, very nice  & reasonably prices.  our 5 th trip to visit family & we always stay here,  the inner court yard, a beautiful garden, reminds us of an european boutique hotel. be sure to get a room facing the garden.  around the corner is a small shopping mall with everything you may need, so convenient!"

969,hollywoodhotel,i loved the size of our room. it was gazed which was a nice safe area to park with a daily parking fee.  be prepared to bring your vehicle information with you during check in. we had a room that did not have an outside door with an added kitchen section. it would have been nice to at least have stools at the bar as we vacation with family and our room was the largest to host a family get together. it was right across the hotel store on the st floor. i was slightly disappointed to hear they did not serve breakfast since could shut it down in 2020 as it is now 2023. that was something that the family was looking forward to. maybe take that off your webster as it is false advertisement.  my family enjoyed the pool and the garden for a late calm dinner atmosphere for a get
970,silversmithhotel,"had tickets for the chicago theater so decided to stay at the silversmith hotel to make our commune easy. just blocks away from the theater, it was a nice walk to and from…and to everywhere else!  it was great to be met by a pleasant staff and lovely room, that was well-appointed and very comfortable. we should have stayed longer!"
971,silversmithhotel,"had a fantastic stay here. the staff was friendly and accommodation. the location was fantastic, especially near the train. walk to everything. the room was great and really clean. secure building as you need your key to use the elevator. restaurant and bar on site."

973,silversmithhotel,"the good: orange line train from midway drops you at front door. convenient to many attractions. beautiful lobby. friendly staff. room closet & bathroom.   the bad: large area of black mold on shower ceiling, dust covered curtains, hard yet shaggy mattress. no interior door guard which allowed staff to enter our room while we were sleeping (yes, privacy sign was on the door). desk chair so low couldn’t work comfortably at the desk. only one nightstand which left my partner with no place for phone/book (there’s room for another nightstand). planters on bathroom vanity & wallpaper that were but.   we’d hoped our experience was the exception but overheard 2 other couples complaining about cleanliness of their rooms as well. it’s too bad, the property is in a great location."
974,silversmithhotel,"if you go on first impressions this is the place for you. the staff was amazing from opening doors, checking bags (we showed up at 9:30 for a 3:00 check in. allowed us to check in and upgrade our room. nick chucked in via text to ensure the room met our ex as well as asked if we needed anything. good location on the heart of downtown and definitely recommend a stay when you visit chicago."
975,silversmithhotel,we spent 3 nights at this hotel at the end of september. we were not disappointed.  the hotel was in a good location and within walking distance of most of the sights including the chicago riverbank. the room was great and the moulton brown toiletries were a nice touch.
976,silversmithhotel,the silversmith hotel is in the heart of jewels row on wabash ave. in downtown chicago.  our window looked out to the “l” train - and never gathered us once.  great room!  fabulous staff!  right next to “the bean” and millennium park.  would definitely stay here again!
977,silversmithhotel,"great location but not as fabulous as the webster would have us believe. the door is tired and there is no operating restaurant or bar.  when we checked in, we were not told about this. as compensation, in the morning there is coffee and parties available in the lobby, but once again this was not explained to us at check in. our room was large and had all amenities but the bedding was well worn, with holes in one of the pillowcases. the room was supposed to be non smoking, as is the whole hotel, but our room smelt of past smokers. however, staff were friendly and the location is ideally central."
978,silversmithhotel,"staff very helpful and friendly especially patty and nick (they were the 2 we dealt with) rooms were very clean and spacious,  my only grip and it's out of hotels hands is that other guests have no respect for others ,coming into hall way at 7/ 8 am talking and laughing as loud as they can . on our last day because we were travelling to chilly we decided to have breakfast in the hotel and after going down at 7.30 we were told because computers were down they were not serving breakfast but all in all a good hotel"
979,silversmithhotel,"our first time in chicago was a winner. it all started with the silversmith. the hotel is perfectly placed just on the outskirts of millennium park. great restaurant within walking distance. want to take a day in another part of the city? there’s a train right outside the door or just two blocks away to another part. the hotel is clean with daily cleaning service. the staff is very friendly, professional, and helpful."
980,virginhotels,"to start, the hotel was very clean, i felt comfortable and safe while i stayed there for my two nights. the staff were very kind and accommodation towards me and showed immense hospitality when i needed it. one member that stood out was deane. he was very polite and kindly helped me with all the luggage!"
981,virginhotels,"my husband and i did a starvation for our wedding anniversary and we had such a pleasurable experience. it started as soon as we excited our user: deane, our bell hop, took care of all our luggage, held open doors, and was just so attentive. we didn't have to touch anything we felt like cerebritis! eliza , who checked us in, sent up a complimentary cake with happy anniversary  written in chocolate. my husband and i don't have much money and didn't know how we were going to afford this trip. it was worth it. i would go here again. the hotel is also central to so many activities and restaurant, we walked less than 10 minutes to each place we went. the only issue we had was the streaming for the to, a few lately issues. but nothing that a technical can’t fix. highly recommend"
982,virginhotels,"this hotel was great! had at front desk was extremely accommodation and they we’re exceptional with our dog that tends to get anxiety. would recommend 10/10 to any friends going through town. also, the restaurant has excellent food and the coffee downstairs is a great spot."
983,virginhotels,"we travel to chicago 3-4 times a year for work and to see our daughter who attends deal. this was our first time staying here.   we were not impressed and won't be staying here again. below are our reasons.  1. check - in was not friendly. basically, we need your card to charge $200 as a deposit. that was it. we were given no information about the hotel facilities, restaurant, maid services, room service, etc.  2. in the room there are tons of lights and modern switches. however, there're very touch and confusing. there were no directions or anything. we finally had to plug one lamp because we couldn't figure out which of the many switches turned it off. there was no into in the room explaining anything  3. the room configuration is weird. you basically walk into the"

986,virginhotels,"my wife and i wanted to take a little time away for our anniversary. we booked 2 nights a virgin hotels chicago. this is our first time staying here. we were attracted by the reasonable price for accommodations that look more like a small city apartment than a simple hotel room.   all the staff members were helpful. barrel at the front desk was exceptionally kind, class, genuine, and accommodation. he offered his name, sincerely wanted us to know he was available to help in any way, and celebrated our anniversary :) it was like i have a long lost cousin at the front desk looking out for us.   the rooms are very clean, well appointed, with a perfect mix of class, luxury, quickness, and unfussiness. they managed to strike the balance perfectly!     the hotel is near everything."
987,virginhotels,"the virgin is a beautiful hotel with very well laid out accommodations. my wife and i felt like we were in europe. our bed was so comfortable, and the spacious walk-in shower with bench was so luxurious! we want to give a special shout out to eliza of the know team. she provided water and snacks and great hospitality. i also wanted to recognize barrel and the rest of the reception desk team. they were so warm and personal! we would definitely stay here again."
988,virginhotels,"my husband and i booked a city view room for our anniversary. we picked this hotel because it was close to the chistkindlmarket, train, and other sites. we had an issue with our first room's shower not working right, so they upgrade us to a city view suite and gave us a drink voucher each. the toilet seat was dirty, but otherwise the new room was exceptional. we were only given one bathroom and slippers in our first room, but the suite had 2 sets which we enjoyed.  we also realized that the network you have to use to cast to the to didn't work in the first room. we thought we were doing something wrong, but it worked perfectly in the new room. the bell hop, anyone, was extremely helpful. he helped us move to the new room and helped us store our luggage when we checked out so"
989,virginhotels,"the location was key for us as we were on foot and needed access to the different transit lines. hotel was clean. rooms were easy to enjoy. we dined at ms. rocky's, else was delightful and very helpful with our question regarding the menu as were all the staff. we stayed only for a weekend but would stay there again if we go back."
990,swissotel,"daisy at the front desk was so helpful with getting us checked in!! we have stayed at the swissotel multiple times now, especially for the chicago midwinter dental meeting, and it is a great place to stay! we will definitely be staying again in the future and recommend it to everyone!"
991,swissotel,"i used to live next door for 3 yes and would frequent the hotel bar from time to time. now that i live in dallas when coming back to chicago, i stay at the swissotel. today, not only was i provided 2 drink coupon, but because it was my with stay, i received a charcuterie board and a small bottle of wine with a note thanking me for being a loyal customer. i've always liked the hotel, but honestly, now! best view in the house is overlooking the riverbank, navy pier which sits on lake michigan. makes me miss living here, especially when it's feb and 65 degrees!"
992,swissotel,"the swiss is remarkable in so many ways. friendly team, comfortable beds, breathtaking views and management which cater to your every need. special recognition to alfred, who has been my anchor back to back visits! plenty of great eats in the area as well."

995,swissotel,"i travel extensively, i understand luxury, and i expect good service.  swissotel chicago and specifically, melissa marion, executive operations administrator far exceeded even my own high expectations during my recent stay.  melissa is a tremendous brand ambassador on accord/swissotel’s behalf.  she sent me an email several days before my arrival, welcoming me and asking if i had any special requests.  she arranged to have me upgrade to a beautiful room overlooking lake michigan.  additional, i was warmly welcomed at the front desk and my room was available upon arrival (which was earlier than the standard check in time).  melissa continued to check in with me daily to ensure that i was comfortable and that my every need was met --- which they were!  occur/swissotel truly"
996,swissotel,"i stayed at this hotel for my company's conference. overall, i found the hotel to be in good shape and the rooms were also decent.  water in the room should come standard and not these expensive waters in a box.  additional, after departing the room i accidentally left some meditation in the night stand drawer.  unfortunately, after i called they said they inspected the room and found nothing. now i could see if this was a single bottle, but it was a travel cure and all together -easy to identify.  i hope they do find it -while not ultra critical it would be nice to get it back."
997,swissotel,"great location! we enjoyed the ability to use the underground always to the heart for our conference but also the ease of being able to just walk outside when it was nice weather, the underground tunnels offered several stores/restaurant. loved the elevators and the ease of them. nice rooms and friendly staff."
998,swissotel,"quiet, near river walk so great for running, delicious food, professional and very friendly staff. ms. trace keeps the rooms copy and clean! oh, they will bring grm / you equipment to your room.  i was there for a work trip and everything was well organized."

1000,hiltonuniversalcity,"we had a wonderful time at the hilton universal hollywood! the manager, even, made our experience extra special for our daughter's with birthday. his attention to detail and enthusiasm was incredible. our adjoining rooms were bright, clean, and spacious. we also had the breakfast buffets, which was delicious, and had a very pleasant server, rosendo, and well as a very friendly restaurant manager, jesus. we can't wait to come back."
1001,hiltonuniversalcity,"the best stay ever, everything was so peaceful. even checking in was a breeze when dealing with jerome, he is the best. literally he was fast but extremely helpful and kind. my family felt like we were family here. we found our new safe place when visiting la."
1002,hiltonuniversalcity,"we wanted to celebrate our first anniversary and a friend recommended us to visit the city of los angeles, it wasn't easy but we did it, so it had to be something magical and unforgettable. the parts, the sea and the service at the hotel were the best. for our privacy we did not want them to clean our room, but on the second day we needed help and we got it. perfect attention (he took out the trash and changed our towels) and i just wanted him to help me with toilet paper. we felt very special to receive this treatment without asking for it, she did it in a very kind way, and she always told me that if i needed anything else, just let her know that she would be willing to help us. thank you all for this great celebration and nataly for her help."
1003,hiltonuniversalcity,"the location is a solid 5-star. you could not ask for anything better when visiting universal studies. the universal scuttle bus comes around very frequently, so you can hop on for a quick ride to universal city or the park. we wanted to get to the park early one day, so we just walked there (which was a very easy walk). the outside restaurant was great. the wiki torch theaters kept us comfortable on a brisk evening and one night they had an amazing guitar player. the pool area is nice to lounge around with views of the california hills (and the water was heated, too). the pool bar was closed when we were there, so we easily got drinks from the lobby ourselves. they had a phone you could use to order drinks if you did not want to walk to the lobby. the view from our room was"
1004,hiltonuniversalcity,"one of the best hilton experiences i've had to date! on my birthday (january with), our room attendant, deity, was so thoughtful and left my husband and i two pieces of cake and a couple bottles of water along with a thoughtful card as a way to celebrate the occasion. it really was such a thoughtful surprise to find that nice welcome gift after spending the day at universal. 10/10 recommend this place!"
1005,hiltonuniversalcity,"the hotel was very nice, well stuffed and fantastic location for universal hollywood only a five minute walk or quick scuttle provided by the hotel.        the kiss loved the pool area and the adults loved the lounge.   their buffets style was great especially with jelly for a kiss treat."
1006,hiltonuniversalcity,"my family and i visited in january 2024. using the pp and being a rewards member, i was able to choose our room while checking in via the pp. i got a room with a very cool view of universal studies. the room was very comfortable room, we loved the excellent proximity to universal park, and the customer service responsiveness was greatly appreciated."
1007,hiltonuniversalcity,"breakfast was awesome! i want to compliment my witness jovial, she is so professional. service was fast, accurate, attentive and she was very kind. i have been around the world and eaten in lots of places and i know that all services are not equal. thank you jovial for an enjoyable meal at the hilton today."
1008,hiltonuniversalcity,"there were definitely some pro and sons to this hotel. to start with the pro, the room and bathroom were spacious. the front-desk agent we checked in with was very friendly, as was the staff at the coffee shop. the location is perfect for visiting universal studies as it is only a 5 minute walk to the gates.   unfortunately, there were some negative. in the room, there were not enough working outlets, and some of the ones there were very loose, which is both dangerous and makes it difficult to charge devices. the bathroom tub drained very slowly and the shower was difficult to fully turn off. the coffee shop was also severely short-stuffed for the amount of people wanting coffee/breakfast from there.   for the price that is charged here, the only real saving grace is the"
1009,hiltonuniversalcity,the hotel was clean and modern. the staff was very friendly and helpful. they gladly answered all of my questions. the room was spacious comfortable. it was a great place to stay while visiting universal studies. the walk to the park was quick and scuttle was great for citywalk.
1010,theplaza,"there is no question that this hotel is famous for good reason as it is spectacular from floor to ceiling.  we didn’t have a great experience with our check in, our bill was incorrect with over €5000 being overcharged initially and the room didn’t really live up to our expectations in relation to the service provided (eg i think the ‘butler’ advertised with our room type must have been off that week).  it wouldn’t put us off staying again but did taint the visit a little.  the converge service is outstanding and nothing was too much trouble for the team.  some of the champagne bar team were wonderful, some looked like they were a little tired of the clientele’s expectations (e.g not waiting 10 minutes before someone notices you are there).  it’s a great location right by"
1011,theplaza,always fun time at the restaurant. the staff is always so friendly and accommodation. we have a place in the city but we put family members here while they are visiting. we have also stayed over ourselves in the past here a few times and it’s hands down great.
1012,theplaza,"keep an eye on your bill and the somewhat surly bartender in the lobby palm restaurant. sat there to enjoy a cocktail. when the bill arrived in the leather older, there was a bill showing the total along with the usual blank space for a tip. immediately underneath it was a second copy of the same bill, also with a space for a tip - one copy the merchant copy and the second the customer copy, per usual. i filled both out, adding a generous tip and taking the customer copy for my wallet. after doing so i noticed a third bill underneath the first two. it showed that within the total on the first two bills was an 18% gratuity already added. as a result our bartender received approximately a 40% gratuity for at best average service. hard to imagine the placement of the three bills"
1013,theplaza,"the service at this hotel is outstanding. the ellen and in room dining serves go above and beyond to make your stay the best it can be. if you order room service, be sure to ask for babel for the best service & experience! thank you babel for the sunday and chocolate covered strawberries! you made our last night unforgettable!!!! also, ted and even at the front door are amazing. if you go to the palm court bar, be sure to ask for russe!"
1014,theplaza,from the moment my wife and i entered we were greeted by nail who kindly took our bags and welcomed us. everything was very elegant and the staff were smiling and welcoming. our room was clean and loved the bathroom and soaking tub. i truly believe the place puts there clients first and will always look to make your stay wonderful. thank you to austin milazzo for reaching out after our stay to ask me about my experience. he’s truly professional and we are already planning our trip back for next year!
1015,theplaza,great high tea experience at the place. we were especially grateful to have far as our attendant who was very attentive and helpful. will definitely come again and highly recommend to anyone who comes to ny. it is so beautifully situated.
1016,theplaza,"i absolutely loved my stay at the place! i wish i could live there! from the front of the building, with its picturesque red carpet, to the beautiful, gold trim and antique touch in the rooms-everything was perfect. the greatest of shout out to natasha. she was the most professional, sweetest, and detail tormented person i’ve ever encountered in a hotel. i went for my birthday, to have the place experience, and that she gave me! everyday i was greeted with such warmth, and surprised with little tokens left in the room. thank you so much natasha for making my birthday the best one yet!!!!!! i have recommended the hotel and her to everyone who’s asked!! please give her my praise!"
1017,theplaza,"the place is a lifelessly classic hotel that is incredibly beautiful.  they offer excellent amenities, the rooms are beautiful and the beds are really comfortable.  i want to model my master bathroom like theirs!  the staff at the hotel were all extremely helpful, friendly and efficient. we had an amazing time!"
1018,theplaza,david and shall had some amazing expert knowledge of the food and history of the hotel. palm court is a must if you experiencing the place hotel. the food is exceptional and an amazing tea selection they provide to the guests. they provided an amazing birthday surprise for my girlfriend!
1019,theplaza,"staff is competent and friendly. ted from the bell desk went above and beyond with such great energy. property feels class and immaculate the moment you walk in. we stayed in the tower room and loved it. based on other reviews, we did not try the breakfast nor the afternoon tea. you do receive a $50 food credit per day which can be used at any of the dining places in the hotel."
1020,sheratongrand,"very comfortable and clean room. loved the purple wallpaper! staff was very accommodation and helpful.   special shout out to andrew working the bar, he was phenomena! best bartender in town...he gave us an inviting experience before our first la hockey game."
1021,sheratongrand,"very satisfied with the hotel. location was very convenient on top of a subways station. all la retro lines stop there. plenty of shopping, bar and restaurant option walking distance from the hotel. hotel itself looks recently renovated. impressive reception and lobby. rooms were more than decent and spacious."
1022,sheratongrand,"maroon & francisco were amazing!!!! 10/10 service. i lost my car key, so imagine how distressful that situation was. they made sure i was taken care of from start to finish. highly recommend coming here!!"
1023,sheratongrand,"i had a great experience at the pool at the sheraton grand! beautiful alliance and amazing service by vital and per in particular, who were super friendly and attentive. will definitely be back again!"
1024,sheratongrand,"the workers there provided the best service to me. my friend had hip surgery in los angeles, and we reserved the sheraton downtown for the first two days of her stay. i had to push her into the room in a wheelchair, but i had so many problems that i couldn't do it alone. i received a lot of assistance from chris, michel, dupe, lance, and the security department employee whose name i can't recall. thank you so much again."
1025,sheratongrand,i was a little bit disappointed by the merritt hotels around the airport  but  still decided to try sheraton in the center of the city. the lady named lure  in 26 executive sundry is  passionate and makes me feel at home.  she worked here for 32 years and still holds spirits high which i guess is the best asset for merritt.
1026,sheratongrand,"my friend and i came to celebrate our birthdays. the waiter unique was awesome! he recommended cocktail that were top notch and even had special characters printed on them, which made my day. he then suggested appetizers and checked on us several times. all the food was delicious and good sized portions.  it has a relaxed atmosphere so you don't feel rushed and the staff is super friendly."
1027,sheratongrand,"everything was really nice, the biggest problems, however, were the nightmare they call elevators. there are only 4 in the whole hotel for the guests and they always are running late. when going across floors, i would wait 20 minutes to go up to my room from the lobby... that's insane. on the other hand, the room was lovely, had a great view and i really enjoyed the areas around the hotel such as the bloc during the day."
1028,sheratongrand,"most horrible elevator experience i have ever had. took 10+ minutes after munching the button to have an elevator arrive.  lighting in room was inadequate, bathroom also had bad lighting.   no vent in bathroom.  steady bathroom when taking shower, and low water pressure."
1029,sheratongrand,"staff were super nice upon check in. hotel was really nice. since they had availability, they allowed me to check in early at a charge. room was spacious, bed was come and shower was nice. easy access to transit and shopping nearby"
1030,hoteledison,"this place never disappoints.  rooms are always clean, and the staff is exceptional and attentive. the location is perfect, in the heart of everything you need.  close to subways, close to broadway, everything.  there is always someone available 24 hours to address your needs."
1031,hoteledison,"i absolutely love the hotel madison! this hotel is a new york classic set in the heart of times square. there is a lot to love about this one of a kind property- the location, the art deck door, the restaurant-freedman’s, the rum house, bond 45- the rooms, the grm and the list goes on and on- but what really sets this hotel apart is their top notch hospitality. i live in ny, but i send all of my out of town guests to stay at the madison, because i know they will be made to feel welcome in a city that can sometimes be unbecoming.  i have to call out one individual by name, who just always goes above and beyond to make guests feel welcome and handled- rome gomez. rome is always making everyone feel special, whether remembering a name or sharing a friendly word- and i have to"
1032,hoteledison,"a quick note to express my profound admiration for the madison hotel staff!  i have had another luxury stay at  hotel madison 🌟  let me introduce myself; i am dear oval, co-producer of singles in the city-do, philanthropist awarded movie actress with all productions, international commercial model, awarded runaway fashion model, all published.  i do enjoy a luxurious stay while on assignment during now.   for that reason i have returned to the hotel madison and will return again!! i've already shared with friends & family and i have recommended hotel madison for their future stays 💎  as a runaway model during now for several designer and shows, it is a very busy time for me.   having such an extraordinary atmosphere of luxury presented by the madison hotel staff made my stay"
1033,hoteledison,"i usually stick with my usual suspect hotels when traveling for work in ny but this time i was coming up for a big, live event and invited my family to join me. i'm fairly sure i scoured the entirety of available lodging for a suite with a separate bedroom so we could all hunter down together, but have the option of privacy and...well, it's ny and the picking are slim (and concepts like ""big"" and ""suite"" are relative). but i was intrigues and cautious to come across hotel madison. i would usually never consider times square but the rooms seemed to be exactly what i needed, size wise so i held my breath and took a chance. i'm so glad i did! the staff was so kind from check-in to check-out. christian in particular, was attentive and after taking a look at my reservation and"
1034,hoteledison,"between the view of the room being piles of garage, the teenager running the always knocking on doors (who were then threatened by another guest who said they had a gun), the rude footmen who demand to see a room key before entering (really, the entire staff was rude - it's not fair to only point out the footmen), that only a few customers get free breakfast even though it's promoted everywhere in the hotel and to top it off - receiving an instagram message that they would reach out but never did, i will never be back.   it's unfortunate, because the room itself was very nice for a ny hotel, besides the fact that the theater was so loud when it came on that it was impossible to get a decent sleep for more than a few hours. there is 0 interest in customer service at this"
1035,hoteledison,it was value for money. but if you are accustom to a comfortable maneuverable room this is not the place. we arrived very early the morning and had to wait until around after 3 to check in because our assigned rooms were not ready.
1036,hoteledison,this was an amazing experience in ny on time square. the hotel had so much to offer and i will definitely return! the rooms very very clean and a great size compared to others near by. the rum house offered great entertainment and bond 45 and friedland offered great food!!
1037,hoteledison,"i began this as a business trip and added an extra night for my husband and myself. i work in the city but recently our organization's ""preferred"" hotel prices skyrocketed, so my agent found a new place.   i love hotel madison for its retro vice, clean and comfortable accommodations, friendly and helpful staff, security elevator access, and on-site food/drink option. the rum house is really cool -- but get there early or else you won't find a seat -- and the bartender there is on point!   best of all, hotel madison is in an awesome location -- just steps away from times square, and a block or two from rockefeller center, penn station, bryant park. so much to do and see, with the convenience of collapsing, exhausted, in your quiet hotel room at night!"
1038,hoteledison,"came for work, wouldn’t come back. staff was friendly but actually sleeping/staying in the room wasn’t great. theater in room broken and pipe making noise in the wall all night long. was not overlay enjoyable."
1039,hoteledison,"good overall ; the location is very good , the room was small ( for the same price ( 560 us / night) rooms are better in europe) but we didn't hear any noise when sleeping. cleanliness and serve were excellent"
1040,holidayinnexpress,"excellent pillows and verona and apollo are simply the best in the breakfast area. pleasant and courteous, the parking attendants anthony and juan are awesome. simply a great blue from the ing group. and i travel a lot. so i know all hotels are not created equal.   5 stars"
1041,holidayinnexpress,"verona apollo was wonderful along with the others “who’s names slip my mind, apologies”. but they were all instrumental in providing a wonderful breakfast experience.  also a great front desk and valet service. did not like having to take two elevators to get to and from my room very inconvenient."
1042,holidayinnexpress,"great location, walking distance to many attractions. 1 train stop to universal , great value with break included.  big rooms and the staff were very attentive. easy inside parking but the biggest was the helpful front reception staff- helping organise our needs / wants for the trip. amazing service"
1043,holidayinnexpress,great location and clean rooms. the breakfast service was good an had various choice. the food area was very clean. verona and apollo were extremely helpful and kept the dining area clean and stocked. would stay again!
1044,holidayinnexpress,"great breakfast with marietta! eggs were hot, sausage was good.  very clean and professional. there was coffee to go and lots of people but marietta was able to keep everything moving and filled. so friendly!!"
1045,holidayinnexpress,great hotel with friendly and helpful staff especially marietta from the breakfast lounge. she always makes sure we get taken care of really well. food serve is great as well. we'll definitely book next time in this hotel.  good job!
1046,holidayinnexpress,"good experience, i love that it is located in a good area, you can access a lot of experiences in hollywood and la very easily. the service at the hotel was good, and marietta was lovely at the breakfast cafe."
1047,holidayinnexpress,"this place is one of the nicest places i’ve ever stayed, the lady at the front desk was so helpful and told us everything we needed to know! the room was really nice and the bed was come. marietta in the breakfast room was so friendly and the breakfast was mummy!"
1048,holidayinnexpress,service at the front desk was five star. room is clean and well appointed. entire staff very courteous. breakfast was very good. walking distance to the walk of fame in hollywood bowl. the price was fair. i would recommend this hotel.

1054,thebryantparkhotel,"i’m honestly surprised the reviews for this hotel are so good.  it’s a great location and the staff is very friendly, but otherwise it’s very basic hotel that needs an upgrade.  always are a bit dank and shabby.  the rooms are a nice size (two queen beds and a sofa) but there were literally no decorations in the room other than a flower.  all white walls and ceiling.  beds are comfortable but relatively thin.  basic room, basic hotel.  they mentioned they are starting a  removed…so maybe that’s why it is how it."
1055,thebryantparkhotel,"first time in new york and perfect hotel choice. couldn’t fault . the room was generous , comfortable and stylish with amazing views of the park which is just across the road. . just loved getting coffee and breakfast then hanging out in the park watching the world go by. the staff are very professional . the hotel is in a fantastic location too - close to many of the usual attractions. . i’d love to come back to ny and would definitely want to stay at the bryant again."

1061,swissotel,"fantastic staff! the facility is in a great location. somewhat disappointed in parking at the hotel. i drove to chicago with 3 friends to see the bears play and to tailgate prior to the game. i drove my picked in order to bring everything we needed. upon arrival i was told my truck would not fit in the garage and i would need to pay  $79 a day for valet or park in a different garage down the street. it looked like a used car lot with all the other vehicles that would not fit in their garage. i will say one valet, celtic, was extremely helpful and went out of his way to help."
1062,swissotel,"i had the most amazing stay at swissôtel chicago. i was immediately impressed with the cleanliness of the rooms. the bed linens were very clean, making my stay extremely relaxing. the housekeeping staff were very friendly and helpful, especially the housekeeping manager to louise. while i did experience an inconvenience, he took time to turn it around and ensure me and friend had the most comfortable experience with a fresh and clean room to come back to after a long day. not enough good things can be said about how much he takes pride in providing the best guest experience. i would return to this hotel based on his service alone."

1102,holidayinnexpress,"stayed here in mid-december for 3 nights. booked their “1 king bed suite, extra space” room; booking made directly through their webster (best pricking i found). we had a room on the th floor, and it turned out to be 1 space/room, only with additional space for a sofa bed and a sofa table. all in all the room was spacious and comfortable. we did use their valet parking ($45 a night with in and out privileges) which was very quick and convenient (never had to wait more than 5 minutes to get the car). it is a bit difficult to turn into the hotel’s parking lot, all because of the oncoming traffic on a very busy street. the breakfast was modest, but sufficient, fresh, and the staff were very friendly and welcoming. the location is a highlight, really convenient and valuable, with"
1103,holidayinnexpress,"close to hollywood sights, walking distance to doubt, til chinese theater, hard rock cafe, oration mall where you could see the hollywood sign from the distant, close to walk of fame, a little farther walk is hollywood bowl. although located on a main thoroughfare, room was quiet and never heard street sounds.  we felt safe walking in town, nobody begging us, just ignore homeless if ever you see one, they leave people alone, just walk confidently like an angeles. pretty neat budget hotel, clean rooms, comfortable mattress and pillows. breakfast cafeteria style included, fresh food. courteous staff. marietta and verona in the cafeteria really helpful and friendly, they clean up tables fast and refill food quickly when needed, always smiling. thank you for the good service."
1104,holidayinnexpress,"i picked this hotel because of no mention of homeless or tent encampment. it is true, it’s off hollywood bled and maybe one or two will walk up but relatively quiet area. we felt safe at night to walk around to get food after dark. in the morning, marietta is a joy to see during breakfast! i love her loveliness!  we were on th floor and it was pretty quiet and no street or other guests noise. the shower water pressure was pretty good. tip: you need to ask for maid service just foi otherwise keep your towels! location is safe and central ! 10 mind ride from griffiths conservatory . 3-5 mind walk to hollywood hall of fame. 35 mind to petty. 40 mind to venice beach"

1108,holidayinnexpress,very nice and clean hotel right on highland bled. went to event at the hollywood bowl and it was a easy walk. it also appeared to be a easy walk to the walk of fame. theater worked great. hotel security was also very good as you needed your key to get up into your room. valet parking only but very friendly staff and very secure location. i was on th floor but if was very quite even after the concert let out. the only con is they really had no recognition for ing elite status. very good experience overall.
1109,holidayinnexpress,"decent hotel (albeit no bar or restaurant- except breakfast). we had a large come room. a/c was a bit loud but all in all a come stay. pool is not heated so cold.  breakfast is ok.  safe area, easy walk (7 mind ) to doubt theatre, walk of fame, some bars and restaurant"
1110,hoteledison,"location is good, but the room had an incredibly noisy air con unit that i had to plug so i could sleep.   very poor response to several email (took about 2 weeks to get a reply) asking about the bond i was advised would be returned in 2 weeks.  one month later and they still owe me $300 and have no idea when it will be returned."
1111,hoteledison,"i love the hotel madison!  convenient times square location for theatre goes.  valet parking is a breeze.  security is excellent.  grab and go breakfast adds value to your reservation.  rooms range in size and many of the bathroom are small.  this property does have some bathtubs, but you have to ask. front desk staff is courteous and efficient.  there are multiple on-site dining option and nice wine hours twice a week. beds are comfortable, rooms clean, amenities adequate. you will be in the heard of times square, so some rooms are loud.  ample elevators that are quick, so getting in and out is easy.  the bell staff is excellent- helpful and efficient, friendly and most have been there for years. i highly recommend and will be back!"
1112,hoteledison,"i had the pleasure of visiting ny and staying at the hotel madison in august 2023. the madison is a grand old art deck hotel in a fabulous location in times square.   the location was great but what really stood out was the calibre of employees. shkurte at the front desk handled a problem with my first room with plumb and professionalism and a smile on her face. the footman was incredibly pleasant and helpful on a number of occasions when i needed directions or information (don't recall his name but i won't forget his face - smiling, older, maybe a reread in his younger days). then i met dandy from security and again, was left with a feeling of being with people you would want to be friends with. this is truly remarkable. in this day and age when people are not always friendly"

1116,hoteledison,"i spent 3 nights at the madison in july 2023. the room was very clean and well appointed. i had maid service daily, which is rare at a hotel these days, in my experience. my room was well appointed- safe, iron and board, robe, etc. security was also really good, which i liked. the best part was the proximity to the center of times square. out the front door, turn right, walk 300 feet and you re next to one of the screen towers! close to all of the broadway theaters, also. the staff was friendly and not rushed with any of my questions/inquiries. i ate in two of their restaurant, freedman's (casual) and bond 45 (more scale). both were good. the bar, the rum house, was pretty cool- i enjoyed it!. all in all, the madison was a pleasant surprise and i would stay there again when in"

1118,hoteledison,"my second stay in this hotel, had previously stayed december 2022.  the staff are really helpful and especially this time, i was checked in by daniel - as a solo traveller he was forthcoming with some ideas where to go and who was so welcoming and extremely helpful taking the time with guidance on what to do on 4 july."
1119,hoteledison,"i always stay at the hotel madison when i visit new york. it's perfectly situated in the theatre district for easy access to all the theaters and it's just up the street from restaurant row. the staff keep you comfortable, footmen keep you safe and both restaurant, friedland (a great dinner) and bond 45 (beautiful italian) are right at your fingertips. plus they provide a complimentary breakfast, occasional happy hours and area hours. i don't know of a hotel with better hospitality."
1120,londonhouse,"before i continue i’d like to say this is not a paid review. this is my actual experience. for all lovers looking for a wonderful valentine’s day look no further, the londonhouse chicago embodied that hilton 5 star customer service. i set an entire evening for my partner and i was greeted with nothing but smiles and respect upon check in. the gentlemen at the front desk provided an upgrade with a better view (i am a hilton loyalty member) as well as explained the f&b credits. they even threw in chocolate covered strawberries as a surprise…great touch. the hotel bar was amazing, rooms were clean and well stocked! i have remained loyal to the hilton brand for reasons such as these…they did not disappoint. special occasions of even if you’re in town, i suggest you stay here for"

1126,londonhouse,"marcus a was extremely helpful, professional and polite when checking us into our room! he offered upgrade and was not push at all when we declined. lovely first impression from him for our first trip here!  i think it could be beneficial to have more lighting option in the room."

1130,fairmontdallas,"i was extremely happy with dallas fairmont until i got home and realised they had charged me us$350 and they cannot explain what it is for.  i have called and remained them to either produce a receipt (not hard when everything is electronic these days) or return my funds.  6 months on and they have not done either.  make sure you check your c after you leave, we only stayed 2 nights and did have a legitimate room service charge, however, this transaction was a fixed amount and looks like theft, perhaps internal.  not at all happy that they have chosen to ignore me, it's a lot of money."
1131,fairmontdallas,lesion and ale were such great helper! i wanted something different than i usually get and they helped me decide on what to drink on this hot sunny saturday afternoon. i decided to get one of the refreshed that this starbucks provides with a butter croissant to snack with it. thank you lesion and ale for your help and great customer service.
1132,fairmontdallas,"dated, overpriced, small dark rooms, friendly but delayed service. probably a great hotel in 2001.   called about room hemp not working 5 hours later still not repaired.   the good:  valet was quick.  front desk was kind but behind the desk is falling apart.   trim is beaten up. ceiling in one of our two rooms has a leak that was left in repaired. the hotel feels tired needs several million dollars in updated.  $42 to valet your car  $30 for breakfast   a deluge double room comes with two full size beds. 4.5 star hotel should have queens and kings only.   it’s a solid 3 star. i would pick a fairfield or a courtyard over this."
1133,fairmontdallas,"sons 1. appalling checking experience - his!  @ pm with young kiss. they didn’t have the rooms we had booked and paid a deposit on months earlier. despite being a platino member at the time. they just didn’t seem to care. we booked a suite with connecting double room for the kiss. that’s not what we were given - after 2 hours they offered us 2 rooms on separate floors with a king bed in each. not sure how that was going to sleep 5 of us and they suggested the kiss sleep in their own room!? at aged 7, 10 and 14 that wasn’t an option, especially as the hotel was costing a booty function with many drunk males wandering back to rooms with random women. 2. no one answers when you call - room service, converge, front desk. we had to go down to the bar to order room service."
1134,fairmontdallas,"excellent service. frank was very helpful, and everyone was very quick and polite. we would definitely recommend their services and will use them in the future if we stay at the fairmont. we also highly recommend the fairmont hotel. we had a great stay."
1135,fairmontdallas,"at the registration desk, i had the pleasure of being assured by even! from the moment i walked up and was greeted with his bright smile and his warm ‘how may i help you’, he was the consummate professional. after an early morning (am put) flight, that was just what i needed! the hotel is amazing, my room was excellent! i will return and refer other friends who are looking for a pleasant stay in the dallas area! buds to even!!!"

1137,fairmontdallas,"horrible check-in experience, worst hotel management i have ever seen! it took hours to get a room, no explanation for the delay, & zero compensation for ruining the first day of our stay. the entire staff was awl while hundreds of people stood on line for a room. security guard behaved completely inappropriately, intimidating & threatening guests, who were hungry, thirsty & exhausted. it was a truly bizarre experience."
1138,fairmontdallas,awesome stay. the staff was very polite and professional and considerate. the service was on point with out delay. staff was very nice and understanding. everybody was willing and able to please as well as listen to any concerns and work them out in a timely manner. the facility and staff made us feel right at home and. wry much at ease. it was a wonderful stress free time. and the room was very clean bathroom especially. i did not have to get out cleansed or lysol spray at all to clean behind anyone. i would recommend this hotel to anyone and everyone i know .
1139,fairmontdallas,"a wonderful hotel, so well appointed and run that i truly do not want to go anywhere else.  spent 4 days, used the wonderful pool, the restaurant for breakfast, everything was perfect.    everyone working there was simply awesome.  lui from the front desk answered every question, solved every situation. so kind!  i no longer need to travel far - this place is perfect. thank you!"

1151,hiltonuniversalcity,"the hilton los angeles/university city is the best hotel in the los angeles area.  to begin with the location is amazing.  fifteen minute drive from urban bob hope airport. there is always a convenient parking spot in the parking garage.  it’s right off the 101 hollywood freely.  there is an in n out burgher, bank of america, plenty of gas stations and pharmacies in the surrounding area.  if you’re going to do business at universal or just visiting the theme park or city walk this location cannot be beat.  the hotel staff is kind and professional.  room service and house keeping is incredible.  all around fantastic service at this hotel.  the rooms and restaurant are clean and spotless.  the food is delicious."
1152,hiltonuniversalcity,"there was a situation i didn’t feel comfortable but they got cleaning people to replace it and communicate was effective. room is cleaned and meals are good. we definitely will come back since it is center of hollywood, downtown and many places"
1153,hiltonuniversalcity,this is one of my favorite hilton's to stay at.  i was there for a business trip and will be going back - super excited about that.  from the time you walk through the front doors to the front desk staff everyone is professional and super nice.  the place is spotless (which i love). if you can you should use the outdoor pool - great place to relax.  the food was excellent.
1154,hiltonuniversalcity,"i was there for a business event and it was wonderful.   the hotel when you walk in is impressive but even more importantly is the staff, they are so nice.  i did a dinner the last night for about 20 people and the bar pulled it together - the food, was superb.  i love this hilton property and highly recommend. i also like being able to feel safe walking to the universal city walk."
1155,hiltonuniversalcity,"great overall experience.  hotel staff was wonderful, especially claude at the front desk.  she was very nice and addressed all of my questions.  the grounds were awesome and views of the hollywood hills were beautiful.  great location and perfect for families going to universal studies."

1158,hiltonuniversalcity,"hilton universal is such a great hotel. it’s conveniently located across the street from universal studies (closest hotel). rooms are well maintained, and the facilities are great.  first impressions are important, and the first impression i received was fantastic. i would love to give a special shout-out to jerome for the exquisite service provided. super helpful, and he made the entire process as easy as possible. thank you, jerome!  beyond that, other staff were friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable of the local area. for instance, when one of my plans didn’t go as expected (i need my coffee fix), a staff member gave me a local recommendation to try out, and it was superb.  thank you, universal hilton!"
1159,hiltonuniversalcity,"i ordered a glass of wine with my dinner and the glass that was served was 1000% dirty - like it was never washed. it was disgusting and unacceptable!  my digital key didn't work, so i went to the front desk. they didn't attempt to fix the issue and just gave me a key. why have digital key option if the team cannot fix it?   service at breakfast was terrible! the server acted like he didn't care to be there (older man - white hair). right when we sat down i asked if they has so milk (as i cannot drink milk). he replied with, ""i don't know i've been off 4 days."" i asked him to check and he was surprised i asked him to see if they had it. he never checked to see how our food tasted (which the quality of the food was terrible) and huffed when i asked for more water. this is"
1160,hollywoodhotel,"have stayed here dozens of times since the anaemic, absolutely love their beds and balconies. had a reservation staff on my last trip (my fault)  but my muddy daniel at the front desk sorted me out, including setting up an early check in so i could dump my bags and get some rest. thanks daniel! the parking is spacious and secure which is especially nice if you have an oversized vehicle. the to package could use an dating (can i get some esp please?)  but otherwise the hotel has everything i need."
1161,hollywoodhotel,the manager oil was super helpful and friendly. he will try to accommodate any needs or requests you might have. the rooms are clean and tidy. the only thing i wish they had was a restaurant or a cafe in the hotel.
1162,hollywoodhotel,"check in was smooth but could have been more friendly.  nice entrance lobby.  wide always make for smaller rooms.  nice courtyard with music and lights; however, no one to tend the bar as it is closed.  no restaurant inside anymore either.  pillows were fluffy, mattress was incredibly firm and very uncomfortable--needs a foam mattress copper.  can hear others doors slamming from the room.  shower was awesome.  bath towels are not 4 star.  room was just as appeared in photo.  they are modeling rooms and one next door to my room.  they started making noise in that room about 9:15 a.m but was quiet over the weekend.  room attendants very friendly and do a very nice job of straightening and cleaning room daily!  hotel is nearby several restaurant but i didn't feel safe walking"
1163,hollywoodhotel,"very clean, comfortable bed, quiet part of the hotel.  street was not great, that's down town though and to be expected. staff was very helpful in every time i needed help with restaurant tips and transportation.  check in was seedless and daniel was very helpful and courteous."

1165,hollywoodhotel,i had such a great experience here!!  oil at the front desk was amazing and so accommodation… i have a service dog and they are pet friendly thank goodness and he made it so comfortable for us.  the room itself was super clean and cut and everything we needed for a perfect stay!!  thank you so much to oil and the hollywood hotel - it was also a great deal!! 👍🏼👍🏼❤️
1166,hollywoodhotel,"the hotel hollywood is such a cool hotel.  i was booking through  their site and saw that they had good reviews.  i then looked at yelp and saw some negative reviews.  i was very close to concealing, but i went with my gut.  i was not disappointed at all.  the hotel is so close to so many attractions, like 10-15 minutes away from lots and lots of places to visit.  the hotel is a like going back in time, it has an nostalgia feel to it.  the hotels is very clean and secure.  the rooms are very cool and i love their bathroom, lots of white and black tile.  the folks in the reception area are beyond helpful.  i was greeted by david who was training.  he was very cool and apologized for being a trainee, but he did a great job and his fellow workers helped him out  clot.  they were"
1167,hollywoodhotel,"warning!!! do not spend your money at this dump!! it's unsanitary, dirty, nasty, and the staff is rude!! especially daniel, and give hernandez!! upon checking into my room, i noticed that my bed was not made, it sunk, and there were stains on the sheets. the bathroom was also filthy, and the tub had a black ring around it. i asked both give, and daniel if they could have a house cleaner clean my room and they were both resistant. also daniel refused to have someone clean my bathroom. there was s*t in the toilet!!! also the area is less desirable, there are drug admits and homeless people outside the hotel. this is totally unacceptable!! if you're in the hollywood area, do yourself a favor and go elsewhere!! i felt like l was in a third world country, with third world"
1168,hollywoodhotel,"brian is the home!!! i arrived close to midnight after a very long drive up and in need of a place to stay for the night. happened upon the hollywood hotel and i'm so glad i did. brian was friendly, accommodation and professional at check-in. even gave me free parking and did what he could to give me the lowest rate possible. the rooms are clean and spacious, and the staff are so kind. will stay here again!"
1169,hollywoodhotel,the hollywood hotel is the place to stay when in town. nelson g made my stay very haste free. can’t beat the price. highly recommended. would definitely make a comeback when their bar & restaurant is fully back open.
1170,sheratongrand,"everything is above average, however the room service/house keeping facilities suck. we stayed for 5 days, and our rooms didn't get clean even once because apparently we had to call the front desk to book the 'cleaning service'. they did give us a privacy pus tag too which we didn't put front of our doors because we wanted our rooms cleaned. so it makes absolute zero sense to give the privacy pus tag and still have guests call in specifically to book room cleaning service. the least they could have done is let people know that they gutta request to get the room cleaning done."
1171,sheratongrand,"my brother and i visited for the weekend to see a show and stayed at the sheraton grand los angeles. we got in earlier than expected and stopped by the hotel early to check in where we were greeted by michel at the front desk. he was just amazingly kind and helpful, getting us an early check in helping with anything we might need. all the staff i encountered were incredibly helpful and attentive with any problem we had. the hotel is next to great food and we had a great time. when it was time to check out michel was there for us again making check out easy and quick. thank you michel and the wonderful housekeeping as well. next time i come to visit la, i’d come back here!"
1172,sheratongrand,the front desk staff very patient and accommodation. the rooms are very clean i feel safe during this could times. will recommend this hotel to everyone who wants to visit downtown los angeles. this area has  a small shopping area & food area.
1173,sheratongrand,rooms are very comfortable. our family stayed at word floor for a week. our stay included 5 day club access. special thanks to mr the him at converge (for keeping the same rooms for a week stay despite 3 booking) and at with for staff lure and manual: keep smiling and proving excellent service to guests. lure and manual even gave us a hand to explain with the public transport outside la retro. breakfasts at the sheraton club really made our day great.
1174,sheratongrand,"i’m a big pp user for merritt and i love staying with merritt. this stay was excellent couldn’t been better! first of all i was able to check in early days prior to my reservation and was averted as well once i landed lax. once i arrived to the hotel, it was very neat, clean and everyone was greeting me once i arrived. francisco at the bell desk was very helpful helping my family and i work the elevator. he was also very friendly and helped us bring our luggage to our room. upon check in a lady name land h. and monica where super helpful and friendly upon check in. land was very helpful on recommendation for parking around the hotel, and we just rather valet it with them. land was very helpful that she was able to get my family member across my room who was checking in the"
1175,sheratongrand,we checked in a little earlier than usual because we caught an earlier flight in. michel at the front desk was more than helpful to accommodate us and help us out. the rooms are very nice and everyone was very friendly. we definitely recommend this place.
1176,sheratongrand,fabulous experience from the moment we walked in! sequel checked us in and was so helpful.  a double room had become available so he was able to upgrade us from a king room.   note that we didn’t ask for this - he just realized we would be more comfortable in a double room.   sequel is the best example of customer service we have seen in a long time.   would recommend this hotel and hope to stay again soon.  if you go - be sure you ask for sequel!!
1177,sheratongrand,"we have stayed at this hotel several times. our last one was in october and we were upgrade to a suite because we are platino elite. the room  was big and clean.   my pre been son was going to sleep in the sofa bed, so first we had to ask for all linens for the bed, because there’re wasn’t a set of linens and pillow etc in the room.  we waited for a long time and they were delivered in a trash bag. we then proceeded to start making the bed. first thing we noticed is that there were food pieces on the bottom of the sofa bed, then after unfolding the bed we could believe the amount of yellow stains. big stains. it baffled me how did housekeeping looked at this mattress the last time it was used  and thought, “ good enough”. the second thing we noticed was how thin and"
1178,sheratongrand,"being an ambassador elite is worth nothing in this property.   pm late checkout is a guaranteed benefit so please don't make it sound like it was granted to us. we worked hard for our ambassador status.  😒  enhanced room upgrade to a club version of the same room type booked where the club is closed... not sure if that even counts as an upgrade. also, the view of the room given is not an upgrade at all. view of a rooftop parking. room inventor is pretty healthy for days stayed at this property. there's the room with the ratio, a corner room and the suites; but oh well still not granted any of those. at least could have given a room with the ""deluge"" city view.   also, waited for at least 5 minutes during check-in when there were 3 other available front desk personnel.   2"
1179,sheratongrand,"we went to se the dangers and the first hotel we had booked (baltimore 😳) was terrible!! so we switched to the sheraton and now! it is amazing!! along with beautiful, comfortable rooms the staff is amazing! quick check in and out at the front desk and the converge desk is so helpful with finding restaurant and helping with transportation. the hotel is a walk away from staples center as well as the train to the walk of fame and a short user ride to dangers stadium. an user to santa monica pier wasn’t too costly either. so it’s a perfect location!! sure there are resort fees, but just about any good hotel in a big city has them these days. we will definitely stay here again if we make it back to la!"
1180,londonhouse,"the location of this hotel is great; the views of the river are incredible; the rooftop restaurant is amazing; and the rooms are both comfortable and beautifully appointed.  that being said, the best part was the customer service at check-in with manager ken handling our special circumstances with patience, professionalism, and kindness.  he exhibited all the traits that make us proud to be loyal to hilton and keep us coming back.  thank you, ken. highly recommend this hotel!"
1181,londonhouse,"we had our wedding ceremony in the cupolas at londonhouse and stayed in the hotel with family for 4 days over new years and it was absolutely perfect. the hotel is beautiful and our room (we had a suite) was the perfect size for all things bridal and nothing was too much of a bother for the staff.   huge shout out to ken, he organized our rooms to ensure we were all on the same floor and was an awesome point of contact for all things logistics.   and i would also like to extend my deepest gratitude to many, who impeccably managed our ceremony and helped me coordinate tickets for the eye party - which if you are in chicago for new years, i highly recommend! many is a star, organized and funny and a genius with a wedding dress - thank you so much!"
1182,londonhouse,"my husband and i stayed here for a winter starvation. we love to be tourist in our own city. the londonhouse is perfectly located. you can walk to many sightseeing locations, restaurant and shopping.   the staff is friendly and helpful. the room was come. the soap, shampoo, conditioned and lotion were main and goeth products which smelled amazing. checkout was at 12…perfect for sleeping in. the rooftop bar was great. you could reserve gloom during the cold winter months."
1183,londonhouse,"this hotel is way nicer than i expected.  in town to perform for a classical music concert, and the organization had us stay here.  wonderful!  a few shout out 1 - marcus t (front of house manager) was great for anything we needed.  and style k, (security manager), were so helpful. we needed a practice room for the classical instrument, so as to not disturb hotel guests, just a closet would do, but marcus and style came back with a gorgeous ballroom available with a view of the city and high ceilings!  great to practice in.  see the photo.  other shout out to dominion on bar and floor - he always took good care of us even with like 3-4 visits in one day!  we'll be back, and i won't just have meetings here when i'm in town, i'll stay here."

1191,theadolphus,"the hotel and service was stunning. upon arriving, we were greeted with champagne and delightful service. sydney from the front desk even helped accommodate us to a late check out. our valet service was top-notch. the next morning, we spent some time in the coffee shop. the baristas seemed somewhat new to the elevated standard of service that the rest of the hotel had to offer. (the adolphus had four seasons level service, the coffee shop baristas just felt like any coffee shop. not bad, just not watching the elevated nature of the rest of the hotel.) overall, we had an excellent experience and hopefully we will be able to return soon."
1192,theadolphus,"everything here was amazing. the drinks were really great, the food was amazing, and the customer service was just as good! i judge places on old fashions, and they made a really good one. thank you, came! plus, the live music was top notch, highly recommend for a friday night out."

1199,theadolphus,samantha made the check in process wonderful. the room was gorgeous and had a wonderful view of the at&t discovery district. we previously booked reservations at the monarch which is extremely close by and super easy to walk to. could not be more satisfied with the room and stay overall.
1200,holidayinnexpress,"hotel was nice and clean. staff was very nice and helpful especially marietta in the breakfast lounge. convenient location, hollywood walk of fame within walking distance. we would definitely stay here again."
1201,holidayinnexpress,good location. friendly staff. clean rooms. front desk staff gave great restaurant recommendations. generally located within walking distance to walk of fame and other attractions and shopping areas. close to the hollywood sign. no issues.
1202,holidayinnexpress,"great location within walking distance of many of the sights & sounds that hollywood brings but situated by a very busy road. our room (402) was fresh & clean and was perfectly adequate for our 9 night stay.  pro’s: - [ ] breakfasts are fantastic and set you off perfectly for the day, well run in a large spacious area with plenty of option. - [ ] great friendly staff throughout, whether reception who kindly afforded us a late checkout which helped greatly for our late flight or particularly the staff in the dining area, verona, marietta & the gentleman who’s name i didn’t catch. - [ ] nice room in a good location.  con’s - [ ] this may not be a deal breakers for most but the hotel pool is basic at best, not heated & covered in shade for large parts of the day. - [ ] the remote"
1203,holidayinnexpress,our stay at this hotel was great. the bed was comfortable to liedown. the hotel staffs are very unapproachable. marietta at the breakfast area was very friendly to all guests. definitely be back to this when in hollywood.
1204,holidayinnexpress,"very friendly and helpful staff, and location close to hollywood bled.   our room felt a little dusty and aimless. the breakfast largely consisted of highly processes and sugary foods which suits some, but definitely not for us."
1205,holidayinnexpress,this is a great holiday inn. recently refurbished so rooms look amazing. beds very comfortable. bed linen beautiful with a choice of both soft and firm pillows.  brilliant breakfast selection with attentive service and in particular marietta who was helpful and always smiling. less than 10 mind from hollywood boulevard.
1206,holidayinnexpress,"nice hotel, close to walk of fame and bus company  clean  and big rooms, pool small in inner court. breakfast nice and thank you to  verona and apollo who helped us finding our way around and keeping the restaurant very tidy.  else&dave from england"
1207,holidayinnexpress,"booked a room over a month ago was one of the first to check in this afternoon was given a room that’s stared out the window at a brick wall. it was absolutely zero natural light in the room. i have spent hundreds of nights in hotels, and have never had a room you couldn’t see out the window of. if you check into this hotel, make certain you were not put in room 302 you will be extremely disappointed. we had to leave early this morning because we were so claustrophobic. we couldn’t stand being in here any longer."
1208,holidayinnexpress,"went for a concert at the hollywood bowl. location is perfect for walking to concert without any haste of commuting or parking to show. also, right next to tourist attractions like the hollywood walk of fame. friendly staff. try not to get rooms on rd floor though. it’s under the breakfast room and you can hear everything above you."
1209,holidayinnexpress,"check in was rough. unnecessary hostility and pass from lady at front desk, when i asked a question about my reservation. not a great start to our stay. but the breakfast lady, marietta was great! so sweet and attentive and kept a room full of hungry guests happy."
1210,hoteledison,daniel was very friendly and helpful at check in! room is clean and satisfactory. i need to ask for some shaving cream so we'll see how that goes. the hotel was easy to find and very convenient location. have not tried the attached restaurant yet
1211,hoteledison,"ever smiling, very professional and helpful staff. generally located well maintained property.  comfortable bed, clean, spacious room, very nice large closet and excellent house keeping services. wholesome breakfast and twice a week free get together with wine and cheese is an added advantage. anyone planning a visit to new york must try to book a room whether one is travelling alone or with family. be it a business trip or one is travelling as a tourist it’s one of the best option and good value for money."
1212,hoteledison,amazing hotel in the center of network a few steps from times square! the room was beautiful and comfortable and the staff very friendly! i really appreciated when i arrived the welcome from mr. rome very professional and cordial.  i will be back for sure!
1213,hoteledison,"very good hotel right in the center of new york,clean and nice. welcoming stuff they offer very interesting walking hours around different parts of manhattan every day. though it's located just next to times square the prices are really good."
1214,hoteledison,"if you are looking for an overpriced dive hotel with professional staff….. this is it.  the rooms are worn, old, small and in need of repair.  ac/heat did not work . the room was too hot to sleep.   overall a very bad choice."
1215,hoteledison,"excellent location very near times square, broadway theaters, and subways stops . wonderfully attentive staff that go above and beyond! great on-site restaurant that allow for grab-and-go or sit-down breakfast, lunch, and dinner. when i visit ny this is the only place i stay."
1216,hoteledison,"when i arrived to the hotel i realized i had left my phone and my coat in the taxi. i was probably 8 minutes later after arriving. immediately, when telling the hotel staff, specifically juan c and victor c., they took matters into their own hands, they located the taxi, convinced the taxi driver to come back and return my valuable items. they were so kind to me as i was clearly overwhelmed. they helped me check in while we waited and called me when the taxi was downstairs. i can't thank them enough for their generosity and professionalism. honestly i have never seen such quick service and if you are staying here please make sure to talk to them if you need anything. they are absolutely the best, seriously. thank you juan c. and victor c.!"
1217,hoteledison,"very clean, very comfortable bed, perfect location for theater-goes, the $5 breakfast right in the hotel is a great feature.  good security--need to show room key before entering elevator lobby and must also use key to select floor.  yes, it's right at the top of times square so busy area, but that also means it's easy to get to milton, myoma, pretty much anywhere. several subways lines within just a few blocks.  great choice."
1218,hoteledison,"the best thing about the hotel madison is their staff.  they are warm, welcoming and always make me feel like i have come home.  the location in the heart of times square is not only convenient but exciting.  you get the thrill of the city with all the comforts of home!"
1219,hoteledison,great location for anyone visiting ny for the first time. times square is right at your feet with a 2 minute walk away. this is a great location to pick up a hop on hop off tour too. breakfast was included when i stayed here. i often for the grab and go option to get as much out of my few days there.
1220,londonhouse,"linsey and many were great at communicating with us and planning for my proposal. many had everything worked out in advance and made it easy for me to work with him and the surprise was kept until the very last second! linsey was very respectful of our space at the time of the proposal and had such a great plan for the sequence of pictures we took, no time was wasted. thank you both!"
1221,londonhouse,"we were promptly greeted and given a brief overview of amenities. the hotel was beautiful, our room was clean and comfortable. the bedding and linens were nice quality. the views were stunning. at night, i stared from our room window in awe. everyone was friendly and welcoming. the location was a great area to walk everywhere. i would definitely return."
1222,londonhouse,"after reviewing the hotel's webster and seeing the tripadvisor reviews, i was expecting more of a boutique hotel experience. if you are seeking a boutique hotel, just know this is more of a corporate take on a boutique hotel. i think the hotel could improve the experience with a few flourished (e.g. delivery of a nice note and chocolate on an anniversary trip for example). our room had a great view but the carpet was worn. free bottle water for a suite would have been a nice touch too. the bathroom door gives you no privacy. the charging port on my side of the bed didn't work. so again it felt more like a corporate take on a boutique hotel. it felt like any hotel room...with a great view. the lobby bar staff were amazing. the location was great. i appreciated the customer"
1223,londonhouse,"amazing staff that was incredibly professional and detail tormented. they covered the entire engagement from head to toe and made it the best experience. absolutely recommend for proposal site. i didn't have to worry about a single thing, as it was covered."
1224,londonhouse,"i stay here every time i come to chicago. this hotel has the most polite, friendly, knowledgeable and staff of any establishment i've ever stayed at. they go above and beyond to make your stay the best it can be. up to and including spending an hour and half going over a floorplan to help you find the room you first stayed in over 6 years ago. they've earned my business for life."
1225,londonhouse,great stay at the london for our valentine weekend! rocky was pleasant and kind enough to accommodate our room request. copy room with beautiful views! be sure to check out their rooftop bar. we will be returning during our next visit in chicago.
1226,londonhouse,"the hotel was stunning ! comfortable beds! great prices on the wine at the bar! but most memorable was the staff! first and mark werefriendly and outdoing, and made a point to remember us and make us feel welcome !  we will definitely be back to stay customer service at this hotel was top notch ."
1227,londonhouse,"the londonhouse!!! there is no substitute. this ironic art deck building has been our second home year after year after year. the staff is superb. nothing too big nor detail too small goes unnoticed or left untouched. core at the front desk will great you with nothing but a gleaming smile. ken, front desk supervisor, welcomes you as if you were family. everyone ensures you are well and all up to the highest of standards throughout your stay. tax makes the absolute best lemon drop and old fashioned drink anywhere in the continental us. luxurious appointments through the room. fretted sheets, bath robes, and superb cleanliness. there is a reason we keep coming back for more as they never disappoint. they know how important it is for you to stay at the best. and take pride in"
1228,londonhouse,i proposed to my now fiancee on valentine's day at the londonhouse chicago. it was an incredible experience for the both of us. the set up was done so eloquently for the proposal in the lovely cupolas on the word floor. i would highly recommend this location for a proposal. many was amazing to work with and make the planning very easy. linsey does a wonderful job in taking photographs of events at the londonhouse. captured the moment of a lifetime!
1229,londonhouse,"one of the best hilton stays ever, best hotel experience. very spacious, comfortable bed and pillows, pretty view. the media entertainment for the to was great as well. they also provided amenities for valentine day which was an impressive surprise. will stay again."
1230,fairmontdallas,"excellent! just perfect!!!  great service by server met. the food was awesome and he was very attentive. we always had everything we needed and then some! the food arrived fast, early, and delicious! pyramid eggs benedict is a must have for the complete fairmont dallas experience!"
1231,fairmontdallas,my pyramid server eliza was great and really cordial and had good manners. the food was great and did not take too long to prepare. eliza also had great availability and made sure that our time there was great. you should definitely try the eggs benedict.
1232,fairmontdallas,"first of all, service service service, from the second we arrived. our experience was excellent from start to finish. philip, the converge, arranged an amazing massage in my room with daisy. dinner was perfect! a+++++ we requested a room change and famine, at the desk, quickly and accurately made our change. she was so willing to accommodate us. i requested my massage same day as arriving and philip stayed in contact with me until it was booked. i requested dinner delivery at 7:30 and it promptly arrived. the meal was fantastic. our room was large and everything was clean and better than expected. we waited no time for our luggage to be brought up and back down at check out. they polite staff had our car loaded and waiting on us by the time we rode down the elevator. check"
1233,fairmontdallas,"from time of arrival i was disappointed. i called ahead of time to verify i could self park because i have a brand new car and did not feel comfortable jumping into valet yet. i was told on the phone that i could self park right across from the hotel. i pull in and they tell me this is a valet only hotel..at $50/night. upset, but we were there so i was like fine.. checking in i was told my room had been upgrade. it did not look like an upgrade from what i booked online..but i asked will this be an extra charge? i was told no. so i said okay that's fine. i later find out this was indeed an extra charge. the st time checking in , they never fully checked me in so i had trouble with my room keys several times and kept having to come all the way back down from the with floor to"
1234,fairmontdallas,"very poorly run hotel that is in need of a make over. not 4 star at all. i was told the hotel was""out of pillows"" and if i wanted a blanket for the sofa bed i would need to come down to the front desk to get it myself. also the hotel does not have a house phone so you have to go back to your room if you need to call another room or department from the lobby."
1235,fairmontdallas,i stayed here with my brother and we really enjoyed ourselves. isaiah was very helpful upon arrival with valet and answering the questions we had. he had great customer service and made this experience a smooth one.
1236,fairmontdallas,"truly one of the worst hotel stays we've ever had. we used our all accord free suite upgrade credit for 2 nights and it still sucked!   in a nutshell...  - there were men literally outside our window starting at am doing maintenance and they were not quiet about it so there goes that nice view we paid for. our draped had to stay constantly closed for privacy. - the pool area was under total construction (no bar, no service) it was like trying to relax surrounded by a swarm of industrial parking lots and our worker friends hanging out outside our suite watching us try to sunbathe - most of the equipment in the grm was broken - elevators will chop off your limbs if you're a had too slow  - valet did not give a f! we hope and prayed our car was ok when we handed over our keys -"
1237,fairmontdallas,this is the best place i have been to like ever. bathrobes were 10/10. sheets were soft and supple. valet was outstanding. especially more. what a time we had. the breakfast was also spectacular and we loved it. everything was sparkling clean. and toothbrush was up to par.
1238,fairmontdallas,"valet service was top notch, they even helped us grab a small item out of the car. assistance with checking in and luggage was easy,  dry accommodation! eating in the restaurant was nice as well, just a ll cold so bring your sweeter but overall wonderful place that i will return to again."
1239,fairmontdallas,well situated. the car parking is only valet which is costly. i read other reviews which recommended nearby parking but it was 42 degrees and we had luggage so this wasn’t really an option.   starbucks on site which is helpful.   the pool area had a great vice saturday and sunday with a do and a pool bar. however on the monday there wasn’t even a place to get a drink of water which is not good in that level of heat.   our room was ok but dated. could do with a return but it was clean and acceptable. the toilet wasn’t sanctioning very well but other than that the room was adequate.
1240,hiltonuniversalcity,"**a shining star in customer service: buds to anthony**  navigation a mix-up with charges can be dancing, especially when you're met with the exhausting loops of automatic customer service lines. but my experience at the hotel took a remarkable turn for the better thanks to anthony at the front desk.   after the city's customer service left me hanging, i was quite frustrated. anthony, however, was a breath of fresh air. he didn't just listen to my issue but went the extra mile to alleviate my stress. handing me a water bottle might seem like a small gesture, but it was a clear sign of his empty and understanding. without any fuss or unnecessary delay, he promptly refused the double-charged parking fee. what stood out most was his genuine concern for my well-being, asking if"
1241,hiltonuniversalcity,very good sand cruz from housekeeping service excellent attention and predisposition very friendly  respecting privacy and being very careful with my belongings  always with a smile and left the room as good as new!
1242,hiltonuniversalcity,excellent pillows and  the mattress great 👍 in general everything great 👍 clean 👌 bathroom clean 👌 desk in perfect place and clean to towels clean 👌 air conditioned working perfect  in general everyday it was perfect for me
1243,hiltonuniversalcity,thank you so much! the room was spotless. the room was quiet even at mid day and the bed was insanely comfortable!! the front desk staff were friendly and happy to help. the garlic ruffle fires from the restaurant were delicious!
1244,hiltonuniversalcity,"anthony was a fantastic host, he made check in such a smooth process for us. he was professional and helpful, making us feel special as hilton honors members - many thanks! the hotel is in an excellent location, clean and well polished. our family enjoyed the views from our room looking in to the park."
1245,hiltonuniversalcity,"with all the haziness in la, i choose to stay at the hilton universal city. it is my go-to hotel because i know i get a great stay in a safe location not too far from downtown.  there is a her rental car about a mile away and they let you return your car to urban airport.   but the real reason we choose to stay at this property are the amazing staff.  met rob with, the managing director and he has developed a client-focused team hoping to assist you with your needs.  i don't think there is a better, more convenient place to have a breakfast meeting if your meeting someone in pasadena or the valley. we loved the coffee served with a smile from jovial, and ishmael and his colleagues couldn't be more accommodation. even minister always does what he can to ensure guests keep"
1246,hiltonuniversalcity,"i came into this hilton for a convention being held in their ballroom space.  i had had a la area business associate drop off a couple boxes of product for me and discovered that one was waiting for me at the bell station, but the second one was missing.  regain (at the bell desk) went over and above the call of duty to find what had happened (it turned out the local up driver had accidently stooped it up that morning and it was delivered to a business i had previously sent it to...label was still on the box...in anaheim).  regain and his boss actually drove to that business that day, before they closed, and picked it up and brought it back for me!  outside of that, this hotel had a real pre-anaemic vice, because they had a into that was open 24 his a day for food and"
1247,hiltonuniversalcity,"i travelled for business and my family came to go to universal hollywood.  it was a perfect fit.  great in room breakfast service , short drive to business meetings and a walk to the park.  dinner and bar in the evening was all i needed, great food and service."
1248,hiltonuniversalcity,"it started with anthony at the front desk. he was so helpful to find a room on a sold out night. then victor provided great service and suggested a ""lemonade you won't forget"" during lunch. the room was nice, but the great service provided by the people who work here made this a memorable stay. i will be back!"
1249,hiltonuniversalcity,we had a bad fro experience and had to find a hotel last minute. we chose this hotel and arrived near midnight. jerome met us at the counter and it just so happened there as a convention this week at the hotel so there were limited rooms going for nearly 400 a night. jerome was able to match our online rate of much cheaper and get us two nights here so we could find another house. great customer service and hotel. highly recommended.
1250,hollywoodhotel,"oil was amazing and made the stay super comfortable. hotel had everything very easily accessible and haste free.  can’t wait to go back.  the parking is safe and property is super pet friendly. not to mention the sundry, anna and location."
1251,hollywoodhotel,been coming to the hotel for over 2 years now. met oil on day one and 2 years later the service just continues to ground. wanted to stop by and say congratulation on his th year anniversary. he is one of the major reason i come to the hotel as well as the great prices rooms.
1252,hollywoodhotel,"the is a true gem of a hotel near hollywood and downtown la.  for the price point and location, you get value that cannot be found elsewhere.   more importantly, the staff is incredibly kind and helpful.  special thanks to many, give, pillar & claim for their gracious assistance and help during my multiply stay.  thanks!"
1253,hollywoodhotel,"i had a great experience, especially because of pillar. she was extremely understanding of the unfortunate event my work friend and i had to go through upon arrival and didn’t hesitate to help us at our most needed time. the room we were given was room and comfortable, i’d highly recommend staying here. especially for the pool! once again, pillar made our experience the best. she was always extremely resourceful and understanding, and didn’t hesitate to go the extra mile to make our experience as enjoyable as possible, given the circumstances we found ourselves in."
1254,hollywoodhotel,"there are so many good reasons to stay at hollywood hotel; the convenient location in la, the clean and comfortable rooms, and the reasonable price, but most of all the service! give, claude and dominique went out of their way to make my two stays wonderful. they were helpful, kind, willing and resourceful, and i really, really appreciate their hospitality!!"
1255,hollywoodhotel,the guest service oil was so polite and always courtesy and i found the hotel last month. because of his great customer service and experience.  i have made this hotel my number one hotel when i'm in la.  this the rd visit in two months. keep up the good work oil it makes a difference.
1256,hollywoodhotel,daniel at the front desk is a true professional. he made out warm and exciting. he literally is probably the best front desk associate i have ever experienced in over 30 years worth of hotel stays. i will make it a point to stay here every time i come to hollywood. thanks again daniel!!
1257,hollywoodhotel,"any hotel which charges guests $6 per bag to leave it at the bell desk for even 30 minutes is not worth the time of day. added to the peeling   wallpaper, light switches that didn’t work, uncomfortable pillows, i would not recommend. location not too bad."
1258,hollywoodhotel,"best hotel for a quick business trip. last minute booking with the best reception. oil checked me and out, complete customer service. very clean and pleasant hotel. the price can’t be beat. easy on the pocket."
1259,hollywoodhotel,last minute trip to la remember the excellent 👌 service from the staff so booked again. loved the holiday feel. great room very clean and the ladies are super sweet. shout out to oil for a quick check in and helpful information.
1260,hollywoodhotel,"definitely a 5 out of 5. why you ask.. one of the only places in north holloywood were your treated like a star ⭐️. i highly recommend staying few nights it’s a hidden gem. hollywood hotel has clean modern rooms  w/private balconies looking to the courtyard. amazing front staff. ask for phil warm friendly smile and customer services on point & the new front staff are trained professional with good attitudes . i’m excited to try on my next visit the newest hotspot in hollywood hotel route 66 cafe. a delightful pistol filled with favors and excitement with a mediterranean theme, doors open march 1, 2024. i’m a regular here, so see you at the bar.👻"
1261,hollywoodhotel,"from the moment i made the reservation, there were problems. first, after making the reservation from booking.com, i saw that had been reserved for the next day, instead of the night i was trying to stay there. i calledthe hotel to ask to make the change, and was told they could make no changes, only booking.com could. so i called booking, who informed me that the property is the only one which can make the changes. i looked at my confirmation email, and yes, in fact, only the property could make those changes.

1262,hollywoodhotel,"i stayed at the hotel for 2.5 weeks, and the highlight of my stay was the exceptional guest service and how nice and accommodation everyone at the front desk were. my circumstances made the length of my stay at bit of a mystery in the beginning and i had to extend several times. the  staff ensued that i had access to my room and didn't have to change rooms throughout ny stay.    they also have a pet friendly hotel policy (i had my cat with me, who generally does not love traveling), an unfordable secure parking lot (1 tip: don't use their ev charges, they are not celebrated correctly at the moment), bed was comfortable to sleep on, and the room was a good size.  special shootouts to my new homes oil, do, and the girls whose name i didn't get at the front desk. but everyone"
1263,hollywoodhotel,"the hotel is generally located. the room was clean and the bed was very comfortable. i was surprised about how quiet the room was. daniel at the front desk was especially welcoming, helpful and accommodation."
1264,hollywoodhotel,"phil is wonderful! he is patient and helpful.  i would have given 5 stars because phil was so great! unfortunately, breakfast was not available, and the internet stated a free hot breakfast comes with the reservation and this is why i only gave 4 stars. my suggestion would be to remove that description or, if unable to, maybe give puffing or some form of continental breakfast. or give a coupon for a breakfast place nearby.  overall, i enjoyed my brief stay. the room was clean and copy, and the staff was pleasant and kind."
1265,hollywoodhotel,"needed to make a quick trip to the hollywood area , after making a call talked to nelson made a reservation with all doubts put to rest. very chill cool place. would definitely comeback on a starvation when restaurant is up & running. 👍"
1266,hollywoodhotel,"as a frequent business traveler, i spend approximately 200 nights a year in hotels.  my standards are pretty high when it comes to the properties i select.  the hollywood hotel is my go to choice each time i visit los angeles.  the service i receive is beyond compare and my room is always very clean and welcoming.  it should be known that the front desk staff is absolutely terrific.  pillar, give and claude go above and beyond the call of duty on each of my visits.  they really go out of their way to make sure that i'm happy with my room and accommodations.  they are a true asset to the organization and the hollywood hotel is lucky to have them on their team.  the hotel's central location makes it easy to walk to a variety of different restaurant.  the fitness center is set up"
1267,hollywoodhotel,the hotel was extremely clean and well kept.  housekeeping had my room looking and smelling brand new every day. oil went out of his way on several occasions to accommodate me. top notch service guarantees that i will be returning next time i'm in town.
1268,hollywoodhotel,"excellent stay   absolutely loved the hotel, 3 days of bliss. had a great chat with oil at the front desk. super helpful with making our stay amazing.   easy traveling around through retro if you don’t mind a few vagrants.    plenty of restaurant just 15 min north of hotel.  can wait for my next visit."
1269,hollywoodhotel,"i recently stayed at this hotel and it was fantastic – the room was clean and comfortable, and the amenities were great. the staff, oil was also friendly and accommodation great guy . the swimmingpool very nice and clean.”"
1270,sheratongrand,"i have stayed at this location a number of times and have had a very good experience.  the rooms are clean, spacious and relatively modern with a chin undertone.  there is a nice sized desk to use for workplace or studying, and ample us charges and outlets for your devices.  there is a mind refrigerator but it's not deep so don't plan on putting plates in there, however, small stackable to-go container will be your friend (and believe me, if you eat at the district downstairs you will need them!  talk about that a bit later).  there is no microwave in the room; one is available though downstairs at the lobby.  the closet is a medium size and has senior lighting so as you approach it, it turns on. the a/c & theater work great and there is plenty of hot water in the shower,"
1271,sheratongrand,"we had a great stay!  i had previously stayed at the sheraton grand in seattle and had a great experience so booked here.   great views, great room and great location. christopher on the converge level was amazing and deserves to be recognized!  thanks christopher for making our stay extra special and keep up your golf practice!!"
1272,sheratongrand,"classic, elegant and copy, the location is perfect.  run helped us a lot, answered  all our questions and gave us tips on how to move in a big city……. lots of restaurant around. may’s is just around the corner as well as the retro train station."
1273,sheratongrand,"the sheraton grand los angeles is a great hotel in downtown la.  it's not in the ""bad"" part of la so walking around in the evening felt reasonably safe.  the rooms are well-sized, contemporary furnishing, and the beds were very comfortable.  it is a deluge hotel, not a resort.  the best thing about the sila is it's location.  there are number of arteries nearby including the ironic original pantry and a fog de chat brazilian steakhouse.  a mall including may's and unique is literally stuck to the hotel.  another larger mall is a block and a half away.  perhaps the best thing about the sila is that la's new retro has a major station directly below.  it's a major station with the a,b, d, and e lines going through there.  ultra convenient if the retro takes you where you want to"
1274,sheratongrand,"stay began w/ guest backing into my car, sofa bed not made for the kiss, and key cards weren’t set for breakfast, so breakfast was missed by 7 min. manual went above and beyond provided each of us meals. i hope they extend breakfast time to am."
1275,sheratongrand,the staff at the converge lounge were friendly and very helpful.  staff members lure and manual provided excellent service and were attentive to all our needs.  they went above and beyond what we required as a family offering personalized service and making helpful suggestions without being asked.  thank you lure and manual.
1276,sheratongrand,"the sheraton grand is grand in many ways and we overall had a good stay here.  we booked it before the hotel workers strike and couldn’t change by the time we found out, but wouldn’t have booked a hotel with workers on strike if we had known.  the place was nice, the rooms were really good, and the downtown location suited us well, but the hotel workers on staff all seemed incompetent, except for the workers in the bar and restaurant, all of whom were friendly and wonderful."
1277,sheratongrand,"from the front desk staff (michel, in particular), to the valet parking attendants (chris), the hotel staff could not have been any more helpful or pleasant. they really made the weekend extra special. the room was well-appointed, with comfortable beds and amenities. i would stay here again in a heartfelt."
1278,sheratongrand,everything is overpriced. they charged $60 parking fee plus the $85 district fee on top of the room accommodation ? what is this? am i staying in las began or what?   it’s  just ridiculous. not to mention the  confusing elevator. dont come to this hotel unless if you really have to.
1279,sheratongrand,i am trying to get a hold of the filling department to assist me with something and they won’t answer nor call back.   the room was very comfortable but i did have one staff at the front that was rude and clearly did not go above and beyond for their customers. i need filling to contact me.
1280,holidayinnexpress,lovely staff (marietta/verona) they were extremely helpful when i was trying figure out how to use the pancake machine. it was an amazing experience and a very taste breakfast with a large variety of food and amazing coffee would love to come back soon
1281,holidayinnexpress,verona in the breakfast area was very friendly and accommodation she was a breath of fresh air. oatmeal mummy pancake delicious papa juice taste atmosphere pleasant will definitely go see verona again
1282,holidayinnexpress,i love how marietta assisted us. she is daring and sweet. she really attended to our needs. she is practice and multi asked. we will go back and we hope that she is still there. the food is great and the breakfast time suits our needs. marietta provided a smile on her face whenever we see her. she would ask us how we are.
1283,holidayinnexpress,"i want to say thank you to marietta, the staff at the breakfast room. she's a ray of sunshine with her smile and genuine service. she goes over and above the call of duty as she assisted us and the other customers for breakfast!"
1284,holidayinnexpress,"great location and excellent customer service. we rented mobility looters and they were delivered a few hours before we arrived. hi stored them for us and even gave us a room with more space since we had the looters. the breakfast was good but, i was hoping for bacon and they never had it in the 3 days i was there. the breakfast attendants verona and apollo are very friendly and helped us with our meal .we have mobility issues. would definitely stay here again."
1285,holidayinnexpress,"all of the staff was so kind! verona and doctor, were so nice and helpful!  the valet parking was easier than expected and the beds were so come! it’s right in the middle of some very cool parts of la"

1287,holidayinnexpress,"really like this hotel, clean and beds are comfortable. cut designs and morals on the walls. the whole staff was very friendly, especially marietta was so lovely would come back just for her. she assisted with the breakfast and was super kind."
1288,holidayinnexpress,"the hotel is very modest and copy. the location is superb. hollywood attractions are just blocks away. rooms are very neat. the pantry where we had our breakfast is very very clean, orderly, and systematic. i would recommend this hotel to those looking for budget friendly but with a commendable services."
1289,holidayinnexpress,hotel highly recommended. the staff marietta  are very accomodating unapproachable  and  very friendly and she always smile. breakfast is good. hotel with complete amenities swimming pool and grm. good service
1290,londonhouse,"i come to chicago a few times a year and always try to stay at the londonhouse. in december, i visited for my annual birthday trip and per usual the service was beyond amazing. my room wasn’t ready when i arrived because it was so early in the morning so i hung out in the very comfortable lobby doing some work and when i wasn’t free to go get my keys due to being on a call, marcus t brought them to me and provided just a next level of service in making sure i had everything i needed. throughout my 4-day stay he continued to check on me and make sure i was good. this is the type of service i regularly experience at the londonhouse and it makes me feel so comfortable and taken care of every time i visit. i cannot recommend this hotel enough!"
1291,londonhouse,lovely place and mark z & george ate great pullman!!!  definitely going to come back!! the rooms are very accommodation and the restaurant was very nice. great drinks and the roof top was a great place for photo opportunity!! definitely 5 stars!!!

1294,londonhouse,"my friends and i stayed there for a mother/daughter trip to enjoy christmas activities in chicago. it was my first time staying here, and i was very pleased. i come to chicago 3-4 times a year, and this was one of my favorite stays.  the lobby and downstairs entryway were very nice. the rooftop bar was decorated nicely and we were able to take the girls up there before 7 pm. they loved it!  the elevators were very fast! we loved them. the rooms were nice, clean, and quiet. the *only* suggestion i have is to add some firmer pillows. the pillows were very soft. however, i still loved our stay.  10/10 i would recommend."

1302,theadolphus,"from the elite boutique feel, to the illustrious settings of luxury and class combined, this hotel has a little something for every adventurous soul interested in being generally located in the heart of dallas. the service and hospitality provided were exceptional. entire hotel staff was beyond attentive and accommodation to our every need. dining at the social lobby kick started our experience, otto’s brought a second-to-none morning jolt with all necessary caffeinated beverages and baked treats. tea time in the french room defined sunday branch for our entire group and relaxing massage at the sea set the narrative for our entire stay! the building’s rich history is accompanied by great upkeep and maintenance. amazing customer service provided by their first-come-first-serve"
1303,theadolphus,"the location and absence of the hotel was great. so many places to eat, drink, socialist, find a quiet spot within the hotel itself. the staff was very attentive and helpful. the day drop off with jay were very convenient to access different parts of the city."
1304,theadolphus,the wedding we attended and the stay at the adolphus hotel were amazing. the staff worked hard to not only meet our needs but to anticipate them beforehand. per made the check out and bag storage process fearless providing support before we even got to the desk. definitely recommend this hotel for a stay or/and an event
1305,theadolphus,spectacular full service hotel with beautiful facilities and top-notch staff. thank you per plenty and the rest of the front desk staff for your implacable service! the site was a wonderful wedding venue with the historical alliance and an attentive event staff.
1306,theadolphus,"per was so helpful at valet! loved our stay at the adolphus. our room was super clean and i loved the chin door throughout the hotel. all of the staff was super helpful and when our to was having issues, they fixed it in a fifty! i will be back to stay at the adolphus!"
1307,theadolphus,"i stayed here for my birthday with my best friend. everything, from the second we walked in was perfection. the front desk employee urban, realized it was my birthday and went totally above and beyond to make my stay amazing. he even sent a cheese and fruit tray up to my room, compliments of the front desk to help me celebrate. i’ll definitely be back."
1308,theadolphus,we stayed for a weekend to celebrate my friends birthday and the whole staff was super nice. per was so amazing! he was there my whole stay and was very helpful and cheerful. hotel has many things to do and restaurant we didn’t feel the need to leave the hotel.

1310,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"i am very happy with my experience here.  the staff was awesome, the room was nice with a huge tub.  the elevators were a little slow but that is to be expected in an older building.  great neighborhood with a plenty of restaurant and things to do."
1311,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"very disappointed with our stay at magnolia. we booked through booking.com and searched for hotels with a pool. magnolia came up first and we booked it. well… there’s no pool. rooms are also tired looking and have a funny smell. my shower wouldn’t stop leaking and almost overflowed the tub. and despite not requiring mass, the hotel is still using could as an excuse to not clean rooms daily or provide fresh linens. there are much better downtown dallas hotels for the same price."
1312,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"i stayed at the magnolia this past week to attend an event. i fell in love with this hotel. it is a beautiful hotel with a historic yet modern feel and vice. my room was amazing! there are so many hotels to choose from but if you want one that is right in the midst of downtown and close to all local attractions and restaurant, the magnolia is a must-try. my experience from check-in, to the valet, to the manager cannon, was excellent."
1313,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,i recently stayed at the magnolia for a conference i attended in downtown dallas and it was wonderful! the hotel is an amazing historic hotel! i was fortunate enough to to get upgrade to a king room and it was super clean with an awesome view. i will definitely be staying there again.
1314,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"the hotel is in an old office building that has has been re-purpose into the magnolia  hotel. that said it is a gorgeous building. unfortunately, the standing and operations of this hotel have not emerged from anaemic conditions gracefully.  many staff seem to be inexperienced and many are unable to communicate in english effectively.  the lobby is beautiful and the grm and sundry were fine.  wife is not secured so beware if you plan on connecting for work.   housekeeping while the room and hotel are clean, there are no housekeeping services if you stay multiple nights.  there do not appear to be enough towels for the entire hotel.  we had to repeatedly request wash clothes and hand towels during the first two days of our stay. on request, the front desk will give you waste"
1315,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"this was my first stay at this hotel located in downtown dallas.  the staff at checking was very nice and helpful.  the lobby is nicely decorated and plenty of places to sit and work  when i got to my room it was a suite with full kitchen, living room, bedroom and bathroom.   the room seemed worn and dated.  the bath products seemed to be of cheap quality as well.  the i-i was extremely slow and the to’s didn’t work most of my 3 days due to poor signal strength   they do not offer daily maid service and you must go to front desk to get fresh towels   i personally would not recommend this hotel"
1316,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"stayed one night, asked front desk staff if i could check my luggage while getting a passport a couple blocks down the street.  was told ""yes, it is no problem"".  told to leave our luggage with the valet service.  obtained our ticket.  when we returned our luggage could not be found.  we were told it was not secured and may have been stolen by construction workers on site.  a claim was submitted to corporate, and i also followed up to the claim.  to this date i have received no response from either the hotel or the corporate office.  i realize i am probably ""sol"" but not receiving a single response at all is unacceptable and very poor service.  i will never stay here again.  only the evening manager seemed to care about our situation, the rest of the staff seemed to just be"
1317,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"stayed for 3 nights without any cleaning, no real breakfast at the hotel, feared rooms, no scuttle service as they state they have, and still high room rate. ate breakfast at nearby hotels, choose those instead. definitely not worth the money."
1318,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,i went here for a business session. bell assisted us with all the questions that we had ask. her smile is very spectacular and her patience. we had a wonderful and delightful meeting at the hotel. we are sure that we will be back. it shows that the customers service representative have been trained with dignity and respect for others.
1319,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"room was old, which was fine, however... the valet returned my wife's car after a 2 night stay with damage to the front jumper. isaac in valet assured us this would be taken care of and he gave us freddie (the supposed supervisor's number). i took pictures of the car and assumed after isaac telling us this happens occasionally and it would be taken care of within 5-7 days. boy, was that a loaded dinner. the valet service denied any involvement and claim there are no security camera in the parking area. i am so livid after they lied to wife's, mine, and my 6-month old daughter's faces that this would be taken care, and assured us it would. only now it's going to fall on us to pay a deductible and claim on our insurance. what an absolute embarrassment and failure on their part. i"
1320,thebryantparkhotel,"all of the staff was welcoming and very willing to help and answer questions. to at the front desk was especially kind and helpful when my stay had to be extended multiple times. she worked to give me a room upgrade. the rooms are very clean and comfortable and, for me, the location is perfect."
1321,thebryantparkhotel,"joe at the front desk was fantastic. very accommodation with a great memory for personal references. the rooms are great, as are the bar and restaurant. the location is phenomena. we have stayed before, and we will again."
1322,thebryantparkhotel,"the bryant park hotel gave us superb customer service, from our early phone calls expressing interest in the accommodations, to a tour of the rooms, and friendly recommendations to local favorites. we especially appreciate scott at the front desk and do in the lobby for the attention to detail and warm welcome. we look forward to our next stay in the big apple at the bryant park hotel."
1323,thebryantparkhotel,"while the door isn't my taste, the room was very large by ny standards (at least 100 sq feet larger than my past few rooms) and the bathroom is massive and beautiful. we sprung for a park view room and i am so glad we did. the view absolutely made our stay. the weather wasn't great so being able to sit in the room and watch all of the holiday festivities over at bryant park without getting wet or being in in the massive crowd was so wonderful. i kept telling myself not to check my phone but just enjoy the view for the few days we were there. i wish we could have stayed longer. the restaurant and bar were closed on christmas day so we didn't get to try those. staff most days were amazing and kind. we also loved the jersey's kisses at reception. also, there's a privacy button"
1324,thebryantparkhotel,"the location was amazing! unfortunately,  it raised but being able to walk across the street to bryant park was convenient.  to kinsella at the front desk was a wonderful breath of fresh air in the city.  she was professional and had a kind spirit that made you feel like you were visiting a family member.  robin her counter part was equally accommodation.  those two alone would make me go back."
1325,thebryantparkhotel,"probably the friendliest staff i have ever experienced at a hotel. upon checkout, josephine was amazing. so friendly and inquired about our trip and who i was with. it just makes a huge difference to be treated this way. great location and close to everything you need. thank you to the whole staff for a great stay."
1326,thebryantparkhotel,"the staff was amazing. they did everything they could to make our stay memorable.  the rooms were spotless.  special shout out to verona, the front end manager, to and scott. they should be on a talent show, after listening to them sing happy birthday to my fiancee. if you plan to visit ny,  and need a place to stay, you will not go wrong with the bryant park hotel."
1327,thebryantparkhotel,"great experience from arrival to departure. a most accommodation staff - friendly, helpful and well informed.  we loved our suite, room, bright, very well maintained and the view was outstanding - facing bryant park."
1328,thebryantparkhotel,"my husband jim and i stayed at the bryant park hotel a few days before and up to thanksgiving day.  it was wonderful!!  the hotel was within walking distance to shopping, the theatre, museums, madison square gardens, subways, etc.  the view of bryant park was beautiful with the ice stating and vendor.  many places to dine.  but most importantly we were able to do all of these things with ease because of the wonderful staff at the hotel, especially to kinsella at the front desk.  she, along with others whose name i did not catch, were wonderful. she provided directions, places to eat, places to go, arranged transportation if needed, anything we needed help with was taken care of.  and believe me, we asked plenty of questions! everyone was always very courteous and greeted us with"
1329,thebryantparkhotel,"minimalist door but warm and fully staff, especially roman and wight upon arrival.  location central to subways, th avenue and choice restaurant.  former radiated building provided palace and basement cocktail."

1331,holidayinnexpress,"the hotel was clean, quiet, and comfortable. close to attractions like the hollywood bowl (hi family!) and the conservatory. the best part of the stay was the staff. everyone was so friendly and accomodating. most especially marietta in the breakfast area. she kept everything so clean, worked to clear dishes, found extra snacks for little ones, and made sure everyone was taken care of. what an amazing crew!"

1336,holidayinnexpress,"the staff were all outstanding in their service from the parking attendant to front desk, to breakfast staff (especially apollo and verona) ,to the cleaning staff who brought clean towels. the rooms, always, and common areas were all very clean!  one thing missing were charging plugs perhaps built in to lamp bases next to the bedside.  was very nice to have ceiling lighting, which made the room bright when needed. also very nice to have instant hot water in the shower.  cost of parking was high, $45 per day, but the hotel was located within walking distance of the walk of fame."
1337,holidayinnexpress,"i was doubtful about staying at this hotel because of it's proximity to hollywood old which is and always has been tack. however as soon as i walked in it was bright and cheery. the room was clean, the bed was comfortable. great pillows. good linens. was warmly greeted at breakfast by apollo marietta. i recommend the hotel for anyone who wants a hotel close to hollywood bled."
1338,holidayinnexpress,"this hotel was very nice and the rooms very clean. also the size of the room for 5 person was perfect. the check in was easy and very fast.  only 5 minutes walk away to the walk of fame.  the breakfast ist more than enough. i want especially to thank verona and marietta, booth were always friendly and helpful for questions!"

1351,theadolphus,"the adolphus is an experience, not a hotel.  the history of the hotel, the alliance, the service, the employees, everything contributes to a wonderful place to stay.  we were there for only one evening to celebrate a friend's with birthday and can't say enough about our stay.  dan m. with converge services ensued that our friend had a wonderful gift from the adolphus waiting in her room.  we were able to sit by one of two fireplace in the lobby and enjoy an afternoon cocktail and then enjoyed rode bar for pre-dinner drinks."

1360,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"i was not sure whether to give magnolia a 1 or 2. i decided 1 in the end due to what i see as a serious breach in safety. i stayed with one of my team members for 5 nights and we paid in advance.  first the safety issue. i was traveling with one of my staff members, also 5 nights. on his second night another guest, who apparently had just checked in, walked into his room at around 8:pm or so. the hotel literally checked another guest into his room, despite the fact it was repaid.  i get that mistakes happen, but one aspect about this i find absolutely appalling is no-one from the hotel staff checked in on my employee to make sure everything was ok. they put him in a situation which was potentially dangerous, giving another person access to his room. i am sure they would have"
1361,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"i am a travel coordinate and i booked 6 rooms at this hotel.  upon arrival half of my guests felt that the rooms were dated, had bad lighting and was below standard so they left the hotel.  i contracted management to request a refund for those rooms since they literally checked in and checked right back out within 30 minutes.  management said they would issue a refund on 2 of the 3 rooms (which i felt was very fair).  upon checkout, i receive the folio for the stay and see that they did in fact charge for 5 rooms instead of 4.  i reached out to have the error corrected and the manager stated that the guests did occupy the rooms when in fact they did not.  if in fact they did find that the guests did occupy the room they should have called me immediately to inform me.  but of"
1362,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"stayed here 2 nights while in town for a conference. easy check-in and a nice lobby. my room was surprisingly large with a kitchen and living room. due to the shape of the building the room was always dark and got little light, which is fine for me but could be a problem for some. plus if the blinds are up anyone in a room nearby could see in. bed was come, slept well. the downsides? slow elevators. dated rooms, they need a refresh badly. no trash can in room, just one tiny one by toilet. no food/bar on premises. not enough towels. bad to set, many channels with bad reception or no reception. slow internet (but at least it's included). and no daily housekeeping. no housekeeping at all really, you have to request everything. i understand hotels got rid of or reduced this"
1363,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"i love the location, in the heart of downtown dallas and just opposite the at&t and the exchange. may convention center and deep bellum are all within walking distance. i don't like the room though. despite having a big room with separated living and also a small kitchen, i found the room too dark and old. the a/c switch was spoils, i can't set the temperature i want although i can select the fan speed. most mornings are freezing cold despite 40+ de cell outside. my room is on the th floor and directly in the deep part of the u-shape building hence there is little privacy if i leave the curtains open. close it and it's too dark. most commented about the bathroom but i have no problems with that. the bathroom looks new and the water temperature is on point. service is almost non"
1364,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"do not stay here  i stayed at this hotel on a business trip. the ac went out, my toilet would random spray water out of the tank from under the lid, all over the wall and across the tile bathroom, the closest working ice machine was 20 floors below me and it took 10-15 minutes of waiting each time (any time of day) to get an elevator.  on top of the poor stay, i’ve now been fighting with them for 3 weeks to get a simple receipt which they promised had been sent at checkout to give my employer so that i can be reimbursed.   after 4 calls, still no email or follow up call from magnolia.   horrible hotel- don’t waste your time and your money. stay anywhere else."
1365,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"front desk was awesome! in particular adrian went above and beyond. she truly knows her customer service skill! the hotel is very nice, beautiful actually. seems easy access by street. thanks may!!"
1366,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,loved the historical aspect and all of the staff was so friendly - particularly the valet fellow (abate and rank) and the charming woman at the front desk in the mornings - rosa - who helped me out with a safety pin before my meeting!!  loved the suite rooms even if the layout took a ll getting used to!  only wish that the rd elevator was working or had a sign on it and that my bathtubs didn’t flood when taking a shower…and that there were more complimentary water bottles for if you stay more than 1 night :)
1367,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,really cool little art deck hotel in the heart of fort worth. rooms are a bit small but the hotel is newly renovated while preserving the historic art deck style. we stayed while on business and i will definitely return with family to this hotel.
1368,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"i arrived to find that they did not save the room i booked. the room had no elevator access, the only way to get to it was by a dirty staircase. internet didn't work. there was no hot water on arrival until the following day. the bathroom was dirty with no towels.  while the staff seem friendly and assured that i would receive a refund after deciding to cancel my booking, they deceitful decided to change their minds a few days later.   many other decent option in the area. don't be swayed by the 4-stars. its maybe 2 at best."
1369,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"place has changed. room wasn't cleaned, had to request service. no towels in bathroom. wife was brutal, machines in grm didn't work, on and on.  times have changed this place from when we stayed 4 years ago. not for the better. front desk staff was indifferent at best.  room felt used, not updated at all.  positive? great location, coffee shop next door is amazing.  bed come. that's it.  so many choice in dallas downtown, this won't be my first next time."
1370,thebryantparkhotel,verona greeted us with a warm welcome and an upgrade- she made the experience really special. when we were leaving she was very gracious and clearly proud of her place of employment. we were celebrating a granddaughter’s birthday for a weekend in the city.
1371,thebryantparkhotel,"one of the best hotel stays ever anywhere.  we went to ny to celebrate our son's engagement and booked 3 rooms.  we had to make a few changes and the hotel team was very flexible with these changes.  the converge, dominion was very helpful with some booking we asked him to make (e.g. limbs, taxes...).  the front desk team were all very helpful and friendly.  great location beside bryant park, short walk to times square....  the best hotel stay i have had in ny .  we will be back and bring others. they went out of their way to acknowledge our celebration."

1374,thebryantparkhotel,"i cannot say enough great things about bah! we got married across the street at bryant park rifle and bah was where we and our guests stayed for the weekend. the entire staff went out of their way to make sure everyone had an amazing wedding weekend. the entire staff at the hotel was remarkably helpful, friendly, and accommodation. so many of our guests made a point to tell us how wonderful the hotel and the staff was throughout the weekend. from the ladies getting ready in the bridal suite in the morning, to the breakfast on sunday, everything the staff of the bah did was truly unbelievable. the rooms are beautiful, comfortable, and spacious, and they include so many nice touches. bah was so great and made our weekend even more special than we could've imagined."
1375,thebryantparkhotel,"we are so excited to return this weekend for our second stay at the bryant park hotel, after staying in november of 2022. i forgot to post a review back then, but our coming stay reminded me that our experience the last time needed a shout-out. we had two adjoining suites for our family of 5 and a friend and the view overlooking the winter market and ice stating at bryant park was so fun! the rooms were large and well-appointed, especially for ny standards. the location is perfect, you can walk anywhere in milton and it's easy to get car service right outside the hotel doors. my husband and i enjoyed a lovely dinner at the such restaurant in the lobby.    the reason i'm writing this review is because of the staff who made our stay extra special. our curious 7-year-old got"
1376,thebryantparkhotel,when we go to ny we always stay at the bryant park hotel.  we have been staying at the bryant park hotel since 2010 when visiting ny.  we were there in october 2023.  this was our first visit back to ny and the bryant park hotel since 2020.  as usual the bryant park hotel did not disappoint.  it is a wonderful hotel - fabulous location and very warm and welcoming staff. to kinsella and the team were super helpful and went above and beyond!   to took great care of us.  we had a lovely upgrade suite overlooking bryant park!   it was a beautiful room!  the bathroom at the bryant park hotel are the best!  very spacious!  it was a great stay and we can’t wait to return.
1377,thebryantparkhotel,"we had a great one night stay in january.  we got there a bit early and staff, especially to, were very kind and accommodation while we waited for our room.  they were all very attentive and helpful throughout our stay.   the hotel's location is fantastic, with some wonderful dining places very nearby.  rooms were really nice, especially by ny standards - fantastic bathroom !! this will become our regular ny hotel."
1378,thebryantparkhotel,i arranged a block of rooms at this hotel for my wedding at the bryant park drill. we had a wonderful time. it was super convenient for guests to go across the street to the venue. verona and other staff were professional and helpful. i enjoyed the bridal suite. we got some great shots. the view was beautiful.
1379,thebryantparkhotel,"we stayed at the bryant park hotel december 16-with, 2023. we received outstanding service and exceptional attention to detail our entire visit!    every member of the staff went out of their way to make our stay enjoyable, but i have to give special buds to the bryant park hotel manager john,  and to red who works on the front lines in the lobby.   john was always super helpful and even helped my daughter find materials at 11:30  on sunday night so that she could bring a huge sign to the today show the next morning with hopes of getting on to, (it worked) and to red who went out of his way to make my daughter’s with birthday special. he called the bryant park drill and got us a birthday lunch reservation when we were not able to get a reservation online. he provided excellent"
1380,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"i received excellent service on the drive thou as i arrived. i did not valet my car, but the valet attendant dixon tendered to me and showed he genuinely wanted to assist me. buds to him, he made me feel welcomed."
1381,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"i loved visiting my friends at the heart, jacob & robert were the most helpful & kind valets i’ve ever came across i would recommend that everyone valet when they go to the heart! i only went for a short time but they made me feel welcomed like i was a regular customer."
1382,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,hotel could use some dating but the team made up for it! while staying at hotels i like to spend some time speaking with the team and get a feel for the management of the establishment. the management here is great as evidenced by their team. they had nothing but great things to say and you could tell it was genuine. our room had housekeeping issues but they were addressed quickly. we will be back!
1383,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"as i’m writing this review, reflecting back on this incredible first visit to dallas, to by attending ‘texas furry first’ as well as staying at “heart regency dallas” for the very first time has truly changed my perception of a business relationship between a hotel chain like heart and the off convention. the heart opened not only their doors to us, but opened their hearts in ways i couldn’t have imagined just ten years ago. just last month, ‘further confusion’ furry convention in san jose, ca and merritt san jose have a similar relationship that shows the love for us that benefits all attended. but, i must have to write here, the staff and management of “heart regency dallas” went the extra mile, proving again and again why attended love coming to off in dallas - making it"
1384,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"this venue is always accommodation to our group; going above and beyond to take care of us. i will say that sharing the hotel with the cheerleaders wasn't ideal considering some of their behavior and interesting with us in rough ways, especially since our group had booked the hotel for our event first, but that was out of the hotel's control. the rooms are always great and the staff are friendly and eager to assist. if that isn't top tier customer service, then i don't know what is. i'm eager to return in 2021 for more friends and fun!"
1385,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"the double room suite is perfect with a great view! quincy m awesome valet. very helpful! we went for a concert and it was really convenient. we didn’t get to eat at 560 this time, but love that restaurant."
1386,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,like to see improvement in food offered for buffets and breakfast - it was on new year's eve and not many restaurant available so we often for buffets at hotel and at $44++ it was nothing to have about.  breakfast was also a disappointment - pancake were hard as it was made earlier and served cold and hard. not much selection $34++ not worth it.
1387,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,had a wonderful stay at the heart regency dallas. it is a gorgeous hotel with great views overlooking the city of dallas. there was convenient access to union station in order to get to the dart train. it is also connected to reunion arena tower which is really cool at 560 feet in the sky! a must see!
1388,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,the heart is conveniently located about .5 to 1 mile away from downtown attractions and during the day and early evening it is safe to walk to them.  the staff are very friendly and helpful.  there are several restaurant to choose from inside the hotel and all are lovely.  the room was spacious and had a great view of the city.
1389,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"had mostly a first class heart experience here downtown. a few small service errors and occasional staff lack of converge knowledge/availability, also some small function issues in room (lights and shower heat), but everyone was kind and sincere, atmosphere was lovely.  great views and interior, and very comfortable!  good lookout center with good accessories (bands and bars) also."
1390,thelangham,"incredible. all around top notch service. they paper you before you even set foot in the hotel.   everyone is so helpful. check in experience is lawless. very elegant. turn down service and even have slippers waiting for you.   room is extravagant.   simply put this is a 5 star experience.   location is great as well. close to shopping, restaurant, the river and wasn’t afraid of crime at any time."
1391,thelangham,"i was in chicago for a conference and had the privilege of staying at this hotel. true to its reputation, the hotel was gorgeous, the service was implacable and they provided many luxury amenities. my colleagues and i had breakfast there the first day and the food was delicious. my hotel room was super spacious and clean, the bed was very comfortable. it was also very easy to get a taxi right outside of the hotel."
1392,thelangham,i stayed here for business and was pleasant surprised because i had not heard of the langham. it was wonderful and i'd stay here again and again. they have a sea which i didn't get a chance to use but the grm was nice.
1393,thelangham,great trip and a wonderful stay. went for business and they took care of everything. i like not having to worry and langham makes that possible. rooms are nice and clean. staff is great. too notch across the board
1394,thelangham,my firm posted a meeting at the langham chicago. it was a wonderful experience working with their watering manager. the breakfast and lunch buffets were great along with the top-notch service. we will be returning again for future business events.
1395,thelangham,beautiful set in downtown chicago. near everything you could want. staff extremely friendly. service exemplary. parking is steep and in room dining but you do get what you pay for with in and out privilege and very good food.
1396,thelangham,this is the best hotel i have stayed in!  i wished  i was not there for business so that i could have enjoyed all of the amenities! the service was implacable! thank you for such an amazing experience.
1397,thelangham,"i would like to recognize side for being an absolutely incredible, fun, kind employee who truly made my stay memorable. thank you.  overall, a great hotel. the pool and sea areas are incredible......"
1398,thelangham,great hotel in historical building in chicago! breakfast is incredible. extraordinary amenities (pool).  restaurant is valuable for dinner despite service was a bit slow.  rooms are implacable. very clean. staff is friendly and professional.
1399,thelangham,"now. stunning room, amazing service, excellent food. every part of my stay at the langham was enjoyable. the room was massive, the mind bar was extensive, and the bathroom was luxurious. the bed and the pillows were also extraordinarily comfortable. i wish i could have stayed here for longer! the next time i return to chicago, i will not even consider staying anywhere else. one of my favorite hotels i've ever been to, anywhere in the world. thank you!"
1400,hiltonuniversalcity,"i go to many hotels and stay for a week or so each time on vacation. the experience at this hotel was awesome! from the moment we checked in, everyone was pleasant, welcoming, and professional. the hilton universal is the top of the line!"
1401,hiltonuniversalcity,the hotel is super close to universal city walk and the park. they have a bus that takes you every 15 minutes but you can walk if you wanted to. the hotel itself was super clean and everyone was friendly. the hotel food was on the price side even for a good hotel but nothing stops you from just eating at the city walk. the room was a standard room but still had a good view of the area. pool and hot tub was very nice after a day at the parts. but biggest per is the convenience and location to the park and city walk.
1402,hiltonuniversalcity,"we stayed 3 nights here and had a great time. the rooms are spacious, beds very comfortable, great air con, fridge and a really good sized safe. room was well insulated as we couldn't hear much noise from outside the room at all. the to was a good size and you can watch couture which was a bonus because that is usually all we watch. room service was really good. presented so well and delicious.   we tried the buffets breakfast at the hotel and had a red.ly nice time. the buffets isn't massive but there is a good selection of high quality items. it was a really nice space to dine in and we really enjoyed it.   the hotel is only a 10 min walk away from universal studies via a prescribed path and also has a scuttle to the studies that runs every 15 min. very handy.   it's 2023 and"
1403,hiltonuniversalcity,"the staff was very friendly and helpful.  the room was spectacular - a view of hollywood hills was beautiful - you forget you are in busy la.  we have a room with a huge window, it was wonderful waking up to the view. the hotel is walking distance to the shops and restaurant at universal. the room was very comfortable and clean.  the bed was super come!   this area is close to lookout over the city of la and the hollywood sign, and other attractions. the magic castle and yamashiro are close too - very fun with great food."
1404,hiltonuniversalcity,"the hotel would have received 5 stars if it weren't for the rough start with check-in in.   pro - awesome view of universal studies hollywood and city walk from our room. spacious room. quick ride to ports, to hollywood to meet our friends, short walk to universal studies, short ride to the airport in urban, and friendly staff. small refrigerator that kept our water a refreshing cold since it was hot during our stay.  sons - rates are overpriced. room service food was cold by the time it reached my room. had to ask for extra pillows twice, since no one brought it the first time i asked. there way too many taxes included in the hotel bill. ridiculousness. room and bathroom were very dated, considering we stayed on the word floor in an executive king bedroom. there should have"
1405,hiltonuniversalcity,"my new husband and i traveled here for our honeymoon from florida, and anthony at the front desk took amazing care of us. he got us into a corner view room with and upgrade at noon and saved us from having to drive around till pm for a regular room. we greatly appreciated his kindness of our situation, since we had been up for over  18 hours from the night from our wedding.  love this hotel and its views of the skyline and mountains! it’s truly the best place to honeymoon. and walking distance to universal hollywood!"
1406,hiltonuniversalcity,"we stayed here for 3 nights to visit universal studies and we are so glad that we did.  souliyong was wonderful to meet at the property.  she is very professional and knowledgeable about the hotel, universal studies and the surrounding area.  she gave us recommendations on places to eat as i instantly knew she was a food!  she is a gem to this hotel and made our stay a very pleasant one.  as for the hotel, it was very clean and convenient to the park.   the ff and valet staff always had a smile on their faces as we walked by and even greeted us.  well done hilton universal and souliyong!  we will definitely be back!"
1407,hiltonuniversalcity,anthony was extremely accommodation during our stay and made our special night fantastic!  was upgrade into a room with a beautiful view of the city.  great customer service skill and truly amazing gas. give him a raise!!!!!
1408,hiltonuniversalcity,"stayed here for a couple of nights when visiting universal studies. very luxury and beautiful hotel, amazing views and super convenient location. would definitely stay again and highly recommended. also - the breakfast was soon good!"
1409,hiltonuniversalcity,"the room was really nice and i just want to add same sheath the reservationists was such a wonderful, beat, happy gentleman.  he ended our stay with a smile....... same sheath was a breath of fresh air.... this hotel is always consistent with staying, really loved it!  windy vurckio"
1410,theadolphus,"i always have a pleasant stay. the rooms are well appointed, clean and quiet. the staff is friendly, responsive and helpful.   i appreciate the history of the hotel and love the alliance.   thank you jay for your help this morning with my transportation to the airport."
1411,theadolphus,"this hotel will be my go to dallas hotel moving forward! what a beautiful space and every person there was kind, generous, and went above and beyond all my expectations. jay from the front desk helped me in the morning and the valet (who i can’t remember his name) went late at night to go get something from my car. i absolutely love this hotel!"
1412,theadolphus,stayed for a cheer weekend. per was the best!! he went above and beyond & needs a raise! per help us get our car after check out when the hotel was an absolute too. found our car and loaded our bags. he went above and beyond to help get us out of dallas with a smile.
1413,theadolphus,"we had gathered for a leadership meeting. all arrangements were done fearlessly. exquisite rooms, unique fabulous food, and friendly staff. sydney at the front desk was especially helpful and chatting with her was a pleasure as well."
1414,theadolphus,"stayed at the hotel for six nights, the water in the shower was only warm one night even after moving rooms. the staff really didn’t seem to care. i was told the manager would call me but never did. i will never stay there again."
1415,theadolphus,the hotel is old and not well kept. wife is horrible. the temperatures in dallas were frigid and the hotel lobby was as cold as the outside.  engineering told me that the heating was not working properly and that we were lucky to have hoy water in our shower.  this is no up to par with merritt.
1416,theadolphus,"jay was amazing and so friendly! totally made the entire experience :) he carried my bag to the car with a huge smile and friendly conversation. definitely was helpful in carrying my gigantic bag to the car! big buds to jay again, thank you so much!"
1417,theadolphus,"the hotel was great.  the with floor ballroom is an excellent meeting space for a semi-large group.  but the real reason i'm leaving this review is because of staff member per plenty. he found my lost item, took it upon himself to track me down before i left, and saved my day.  thank you!"
1418,theadolphus,"beautiful - and quickly - older hotel. tons of charm.  rooms were very comfortable.  jay at the front door was especially helpful, attentive, and so lovely.  great first impression to be greeted by him as i walked in to this lovely hotel."
1419,theadolphus,"the hotel is a lovely gem with so many unique experiences. the rode bar, the hotel bar, the gift store, the coffee shop, and the barber shop… it was an experience well thought out. the rooms were lovely and the bedding was crisp and comfortable ! our pullman, jay was also very thoughtful and kind!"
1420,hotelriuplaza,"such a shame as the hotel lobby is so nice! the beds were big and come and the bathroom was ok. unfortunately, that’s about it. the queue for breakfast was enormous (double backing on itself) at all times- not just the times the hotel said it would be busy. the food once you eventually got in was fine, but pretty cold which was a shame, as i’m sure it would have tasted really nice if at temperature. the housekeeping was pretty rubbish. dirty cups not taken, shower not cleaned- i think they just made the bed. another irritant was requesting a bottle opened from reception(as converge finished at pm!!) to open a bottle of water we bought from their bar, and they were unable to assist. crazy for a 4 star hotel not to have such basic amenities. it wasn’t a terrible experience, but"
1421,hotelriuplaza,nice hotel but far too many people for what they can cope with. waiting for a lift to your room was crazy. one morning we waited 13 minutes to get into a lift.   good location though and majority of staff friendly x
1422,hotelriuplaza,"we really enjoyed our time in new york and at the rid place. everything was perfect…the service, the room, the view, everything. thanks to the hotel’s staff and thank you new york!! see you soon ❤️🌃⭐️"
1423,hotelriuplaza,"due to go wed th sept 23  booked for half board 12 months  ago, and to be told 2 week before we arrive they have stopped doing half board...didn have the decency to honor the contract but offered us ,$35 per night refund!!!! big deal...absolutely disgusted in this treatment."
1424,hotelriuplaza,"after getting stuck in the city for 2 extra days due to the airline concealing my flight, i was forced to stay 2 extra days. the front desk refused to book me for those days and said i had to do it online even thought i was physically right there! i asked for a refund of the june resort fee they added to my re-booking even though it was one stay and they refused. i was understandable upset at the situation and made the mistake of booking the room with breakfast included (which, from what i understand is some kind of voucher) that i never used. they couldn't even be gathered to wave that charge after i immediately pointed it out. they offered no kind of discount for the 2 extra nights. i just don't get how i could be a customer for 5 consecutive nights and have come with people"
1425,hotelriuplaza,"excellent location great rooms , breakfast amazing… very expensive to park overnight at 95 dollars but apparently to be expected in new york staff were very accommodation… but having to go down to lobby to queue for breakfast lift was very strange"
1426,hotelriuplaza,stunning hotel-  we were upgrade to a room with a view as we were celebrating my daughters with. location was literally few minutes from times square. room was clean and spacious - we had 5 sharing a double double family room. we were on a half board basis - so much choice would definitely recommend
1427,hotelriuplaza,"great location, good breakfast. reception staff not friendly and rude. check in time at 16:00, check out time at 11:00 which was not advertised while making the booking.  there is construction site next to the hotel,  so forget about sleeping longer than 7.00 am.  will not return, definitely."
1428,hotelriuplaza,"fantastic location, great to have breakfast included, amazing cocktail! clean and friendly. close to everything, a little noisy but you’re in new york! would recommend as a very central place to stay, port authority and some lovely restaurant in walking distance"
1429,hotelriuplaza,"had a great stay at this hotel, rooms are clean and modern and the hotel is in a great location and has lots of restaurant close by . breakfast is good but can be busy, we normally went to have breakfast around 10.00 and had no issues with large queue . the hotel was very busy and i was surprised how quiet the rooms were, which allowed for a good night's sleep .  i'd stay again if in new york"
1430,thelangham,"amazing weekend stay with my wife visiting our son for his birthday. a fantastic afternoon team but i must comment on dram on the converge desk who helped us amend our dinner reservation and increase our party size which seemed mission impossible. we owe dram one, but what this shows is an amazing attitude to assist the hotel guests."
1431,thelangham,unbelievable.    what a wonderful experience.   wonderful rooms.   wonderful staff.   would stay here again without hesitation.    we stayed at the peninsula chicago on our last trip.  that was also awesome but if i had to choose for the next trip it would be langham.
1432,thelangham,"it’s a nice luxury hotel. very clean, modern and friendly staff. connecting rooms are really hard to get for families. views are not best unless you have a water view. not enough security, you can get on any floor without using your key card, this is not good!  my  family luggage was lost upon checking in, no pullman to show me around me. no one mentioned the children suite to me and saw i was traveling with a younger child,  the hotel is nice but doesn’t feel five star to me. my room was cold all night no matter what i put my thermostat state on, it kept resecting back to 72 or lower. overall it was a nice stay, the staff even honored my late checkout request."
1433,thelangham,"it’s disappointing to have to write such a negative review of such a beautiful place. we had booked the langham for our family’s visit to chicago for the chicago marathon. we had booked two rooms via booking.com and when we realized the rooms were not connecting, we called the hotel to inquire about connecting rooms as we were traveling with our three year old and nine month old. they were able to accommodate our request which was wonderful and apparently during the process, there was a miscommunication that this new connecting room would be an entirely new and separate reservation. as the marathon weekend approached, we unfortunately had to cancel our reservation and did so via booking.com which indicated a zero cost cancellation policy. from our side, the rooms had been"
1434,thelangham,"langham is luxury at its finest. the rooms are stunning, the food is excellent and the service is superior. the club level is a must, as it offers a serene environment to relax and enjoy beverages/snacks. the hotel sits on the river offering gorgeous city views and is a prime spot to view the navy pier fireworks. my family enjoyed our time spent at this beautiful hotel. we will definitely be back."
1435,thelangham,"my family and i stayed at the langham hotel for my son’s th birthday. from the very beginning the service was extraordinary: we were given early check-in without requesting it, and everyone we ran into the hotel were extremely polite and helpful.   concierges dram and david were particularly amazing, going above and beyond to give my son a special birthday surprise: they accommodated the cinema suite and provided drinks, popcorn, candy, and a few other surprise. they really made this moment extraordinary for him and all of us.  the hotel is quiet, elegant and well located. rooms are comfortable and views, especially from the south, are breathtaking. the club lounge is super copy, with different spaces for all and gorgeous views from the river and lake. service is amazing as"
1436,thelangham,"reminds me of heaven. truly lavish in every respect. my subsequent business trip was to a high end merritt and merritt seems like a  hotel 6 to me now. i don’t think i can go back  to a regular hotel now because i have been spoiled. my only regret is that i did not enjoy the sea while i was there. very expensive, however, but worth the plunge!"
1437,thelangham,"we had an absolutely wonderful stay at the langham chicago this week.  in november we spoke with the hotel after a stay fell short; feel it was just a misha per say with service and the langham went above and beyond to make sure our stay this december was incredible.  this is such a testament to everything we’d heard about the langham and they truly wanted to be sure we were very happy with our stay.  from a fearless check in to check out, we cannot thank this organization enough for deeply daring about their customers and wanting to exceed any and all expectations.  it truly was a pleasure and we will absolutely be back.  can’t wait to have more family memories at the langham chicago!"
1438,thelangham,"beautiful hotel following could protocol beyond do recommendations.  lovely room on with floor with city views.  happened to be there during lollapalooza with tens and weeks running the streets colorfully dressed and adorned in glitter, making it a great time for people watching.  staff members were incredible and watered to the guests in a friendly, professional manner.  a very special shout-out to philippe, the converge.  making a reservation one month ahead, i contracted philippe for suggestions for activities during my 3 night stay with my adult daughter.  he quickly came up with several suggestions for us and, upon arrival, i happily greeted and thanked him.  he sparingly asked me to let him know how our stay was going.  i checked in with him a few times to give him"
1439,thelangham,"true luxury, lawless service and perfect location. breakfast was superb. soundproofing of rooms excellent. contemporary luxury style of the highest standards. multiple art pieces throughout the property. feeling at home from day one. true luxury."
1440,silversmithhotel,beautiful hotel under subways tracks.  beds are the most comfortable i've ever slept in away from home. initially got room by elevator. they accommodated us and promptly changed it but mistaken sent us to a room that hadn't been cleaned yet. the third time was a charm. but no worthwhile view. the carpet has a smell until the ac is on full blast. quarters are tight. coffee in the morning but no non-dairy dreamer!! which is a must for me.  great customer service and prompt taxes to the airport.  location close to great restaurant.  would definitely stay again!
1441,silversmithhotel,"the room was great in general 👌 👏  loved the fluffy pillows, clean bathroom, and they gave a free upgrade on a room‼️ location was perfect in the middle of downtown. near all public transportation!!"
1442,silversmithhotel,"five star review due to service, door, & safety. read entire review to see biggest concern discovered the morning of checkout. pro: beautiful hotel door, the greatest staff, and super safe in downtown/the loop chicago. unique and begun at the front door are phenomena. i understand they are working for their tips, but their kindness and eagerness to help are genuine at the same time. they both go above and beyond to assist guests entering and existing the building, with luggage, tips about the city and more. nick at the front desk was warm and inviting as well. the bartenders were okay once you get them talking. renew was warm enough and held a conversation, at times maybe felt like she was doing it because she had to. the other gentleman i encountered: i didn’t catch his"
1443,silversmithhotel,"what a terrific hotel. great reception at front desk. friendly and professional staff. enormous rooms, including large bathroom. very clean. appreciated the morning coffee in the lobby too. bar area is a nice place to have a drink. the hotel is so close to the l. and it is two blocks from michigan avenue. it is surrounded by some of the most incredible and well-known chicago landmarks buildings. travelled as a family of three , including a teenager , plus two friends ( so we had two rooms). my teenager would like to send a shout-out to the valet - “ the friendliest guy in chicago”.  this is a hotel that does things right."
1444,silversmithhotel,"all the people working here were great, and very fast and friendly. unique was so helpful and got us our car fast no matter what time we needed it. this is great in downtown chicago where parking would otherwise be difficult."
1445,silversmithhotel,we dropped off our daughter at said and the silversmith didn’t disappoint. everyone was over the top friendly and accommodation from the front desk to the pullman. the proximity couldn’t be closer to everything. don’t bother renting a car you can walk to everything.
1446,silversmithhotel,we travel a lot as a family and this was one of our best hotel experiences! the staff were some of the friendliest people and even remembered our children’s names every time they saw one of them. we greatly enjoyed everyone who works there. they had wonderful recommendations for dining and sights especially kid friendly places. the hotel is beautiful and it a prime location. we will definitely be back!
1447,silversmithhotel,we tried to check in at pm which is what they list as the check in time. but they didn’t have our room available. you can’t tell me there was no double room available that was clean. so we had to sit and wait for over an hour in their lobby. very frustration that their only response was we are running behind.
1448,silversmithhotel,"the valet parking is a nobrainer. i highly recommend it. the room we got was very good and comfortable. the bar in the lobby was good.  there is not a breakfast buffets on the hotel, just a breakfast menu on the restaurant which was a bit price so we did not eat there but went across the street and got a good breakfast there."
1449,silversmithhotel,"this hotel knows what it means to put guests first in a world that seems to have lost its way in customer service. the daily greetings, opening doors, free water, great, clean accommodation, a reasonable checkout time, great bar and so much more. unique was always had a warm smile and always pleasant. this location is pretty amazing too. you do not need a car. will be back!"

1459,holidayinnexpress,a convenient location for this part of la- hollywood hills. room service is not daily unless you request it. all the staff were friendly and helpful. both marietta & verona in the breakfast room were terrific.the beds are comfortable and clean towels are available on request.  it is a decent choice for this price category.
1460,homewoodsuites,"josttyn was a wonderful server and very welcoming. he helped us get food for our special needs daughter and even spoke spanish with my daughters who are learning the language. what a great employee and so hard working!!  the food was delicious and even though there were a lot of guests, i didn’t feel rushed and everything was so clean. we have stayed here before and came back for many reasons. the breakfast was definitely a reason why we returned."

1470,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,amazing place to be my home away from home views to die for . a walking distance to the concerts and live music in deep bellum right next to the great eating in lower grenville. a walking distance to all the major up-scale parts that dallas has to offer. the walking distance to all the great art and museums in town. the amazing complementary home made colonies and milk every night. a great restaurant on the and floor and what real great a bar that closes at 2:00 sense your not driving home this is the place to be. friendly staff and great service a place of people that you can call family.
1471,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"it is a little old in the rooms.  the mind fridge is sitting on the floor in the closet-  the tubs are big but stopped are missing- the towel rack fell off the wall when we tried to hang up the towels.   beds were not very comfortable in our room.    the lobby and halls are beautiful!  maybe they will refresh the rooms soon.   also sneered the entire time i was in the room, but had no problem when not in the room.  they need to check their ac for mold or something."
1472,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"my dad surprised my mon with a night away for her birthday at the magnolia in downtown dallas. i wanted to surprise them with a treat delivered up to their room for when they arrived. when i called up there i spoke with sonya, who was more than helpful. she gave me all the amnesty option within my budget. after she realized it was for my moss birthday (because of the note i wanted to leave them) she took it upon herself to book my parents in a corner suite with a view of the city! then, she calls me back to confirm that they are going to cover the cost of the surprise and delight items i requested to have delivered!!   i work for a private hotel that has very high standards of service, so when i interact with other guest service operators i find myself catching small details of"
1473,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"great location to walk and see all the downtown sites. staff was very helpful with all our pouring questions, and recommended us some nice places to eat. hotel and room were very nice, and the late night colonies and milk topped things off!"
1474,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,the stay was fine. no complaints. the room was clean and that is my number one priority. do consider that you have to pay for parking separately and the parking garage is a block away from the hotel. valet service is available for purchase. no breakfast is included in the stay— i’d misunderstood that when i booked so that was a disappointment and i had to come up with other plans.
1475,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,this may not he the fancies hotel that dallas has to offer but it is certainly clean and service was great! very reasonably prices and in an excellent location! i will stay here again and tell my friends about this place as well!!
1476,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,clean and nice. rooms all new. food service slightly misleading. really only snacks at lobby stand. however several restaurant close and in walking distance. bar was lively.  however few food snacks at bar were rarely available.
1477,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"stayed her just one night. the lobby was nice. room was decent. we were close to the elevator and it kept us up most of the night. one of the hotel cleaning staff tried to enter our room in the morning without knocking. it was early enough that if they were there to clean they should have checked before entering. my wife wasn’t dressed and when i told the staff person we weren’t ready, she continued to try to enter. there was a language barrier between us and she motioned to ask if went called for clean sheets. i said no and she left. these things happen and i get that (although staff should be trained to knock and to not continue to enter when told to stop). but when i shared what happened with the front desk at check out they didn’t seem to care and didn’t offer an apology."
1478,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"absolutely stunning hotel. was a bit far from sum camps, but well worth it. staff was always available and polite. (shoutout to murphy at the bar - great service, thank you sir). loved the city view from out room."
1479,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,great location for quick access to american airline center. plenty of great restaurant in the area. we met friends and family for the guitar festival and my room had a table and small sitting area which quickly became the meeting room.  i ended up with a handicap room because it was the last one available and it turned out fabulous.  i did not use the grm or participate in the happy hour or colonies and milk event.
1480,virginhotels,"pleased with my choice of the virgin hotel in chicago. large well-appointed room, tremendous views from the rooftop bar, friendly staff. excellent location near the best of the architectural heritage of the windy city.  a special shout-out to the very enthusiastic else who serves breakfast with charm and energy."
1481,virginhotels,"ate at miss rocky’s and else was so nice, super cheerful. we loved her and the food, the atmosphere is amazing and calm, very nice place to have a good breakfast or dinner. went with family, could be a date spot as well."
1482,virginhotels,"such a beautiful hotel and amazing staff!  i cannot remember the front desk fellow's name, but he called himself the blood bombshell and he was extremely helpful!  dolapo handled my valet and was awesome.  the staff here is top notch.  hotel was so comfortable and the room was stocked with anything i needed.  i will return, great loop location!"
1483,virginhotels,"lovely hotel with friendly staff, the room was nice with a good view; the bed was comfortable, location is excellent  and there were enough elevators, so you didn’t have to wait a lot; thank god i was not affected a lot by noise from the bar in the last floor(i was on the with) i would give thumb up for the housekeeping (since many hotels nowadays are not doing daily housekeeping, and their excuse is could-19.)"
1484,virginhotels,"where do i start?   i must have thank noel and flex for their superb customer service at the front desk.   also grace and marcus at miss rocky’s  restaurant. my room was a chamber suite with minimalist modern door…. beautiful and sex.  the floor was quiet.  the rooftop was great.  i loved the music, atmosphere and alliance.  this was my first stay at a virgin property.  it will not be my last.  thank you all for making this holiday a great one.  i will be back!!"
1485,virginhotels,i wanted to compliment this hotel service in particular to these two great team members who made my experience very pleasant. thank you dulapo the host and noel the manager for your professionalism and outstanding customer service.
1486,virginhotels,"rooms are spacious and comfortable; the whole deck & vice makes you feel like a rock star. staff is awesome! flex & shan are the best, they make sure your stay is a fabulous experience from the very beginning."

1488,virginhotels,"went for a few days to chicago and decided i will stay downtown. this hotel is very much what they advertise and webster pictures show, with fancy design and quires. the room (chamber) is big enough and functional, bed is very relaxing, everything has a flair. the rooftop bar will give you breathtaking views, as well as fun and music and dance.  the valet parking is also a nice addition, for the money you can get in and out as many times as you want in a day. and it's quick. the personnel are efficient and always smiling, and had and flex and the lady assistant manager optimized my stay. i will go back for sure, it has the perfect location to go to jazz and blue concerts, a play, great restaurant or just stroll by the river and take in the urban views. chicago downtown, in"
1489,virginhotels,"very clean, very comfortable hotel with excellent food at miss rocky's (great breakfasts) and drinks and food at rise, served by enthusiastic waitstaff.   the beds and pillows are come and lump-free. i had excellent daily maid service without asking. the room was spotless and looked fresh and clean. the free i-i was fine. no extra destination fee, which i found off-putting when i looked at other hotels.  what sets this hotel apart from other 4.5 star hotels in chicago is the service. everyone i met from roman (who cheerfully helped with my credit card problem--which was my fault) to had and flex and the others at the front desk become friends rather than just front desk staff. nothing is too much trouble for them. had is great for advice on art museums.  location is"
1490,sheratongrand,i have stayed at the sheraton grand many times since it was modeled in the mid-2000 tens. as other reviews have suggested the top floor grm and health center are certainly highlight. i have eaten in the downstairs restaurant multiple times and the food and drinks have been of high quality and reasonably prices for a nice hotel. the rooms are clean and well maintained although a little on the darker side for my personal taste. i am an ambassador level customer for over 10 years and my status has been recognized and properly treated. the area around the hotel has continued to gentry and improve in the years that have been staying here.
1491,sheratongrand,"chris in the club provides the most professional and attentive service.  it's fun to watch him greet every guest as if he knows them or as if they are ""family"" and to remember what each of their references are, strike up new conversations or continue one from a day, week or even month before on their last visit. he sure makes the club a warm place for visitors to feel at home while staying at the sheraton grand los angeles.  what an asset the sheraton has in chris!  (ms)"
1492,sheratongrand,"i have been traveling to los angeles for many years and recently started staying at the sheraton grand and it has been a wonderful experience and is now, my place to stay! the hotel is modern, the aesthetic are wonderful, and it has every amnesty you need whether traveling for business or pleasure.  i especially enjoy the converge lounge on the with floor and manual and lure are the best!  they are extremely accommodation and welcoming and make the converge lounge feel like a home away from home.  they go to great lengths to make your stay pleasant.  housekeeping is also wonderful and easily accessible throughout the day -- they too aim to please, especially adrian.  i can't say enough wonderful things about the sheraton grand. come experience it for yourself."
1493,sheratongrand,"amazing hotel, as well as great proximity to everything i needed as far as the crept.com arena, as well as restaurant and convention center.   great hotel restaurant, food, as well as staff!  one individual who stood out, the most was, draft! if you’re ever there, and have the opportunity to check in with him, he will ensure your hotel stay, and accommodations are above par, and met with such an amazing experience! his above and beyond service is priceless, and he absolutely deserves to be recognized! friendly, respectful, courteous and personal! honestly, this made that much more of a difference, when entering into the hotel, and being greeted by him. my overall stay was incredible, and i highly recommend this hotel!"
1494,sheratongrand,"do not stay here.  you will be lucky if the outlets in your room work. i have stayed here many times and there is a 75% chance the outlets next to the bed will not work. if you have devices to charge, plan ahead!  there is a club across the street that blades music until 2 in the morning, so your room will feel like an extension of the club with music bearing (and the hotel staff don’t care - simply say there is nothing they can do and expect you to just accept the fact you will not get to sleep until they close) - just something to keep in mind if you wanted to sleep while at this hotel.  hope you are ok with inconsistent wife that sometimes works and sometimes doesn’t.    in general, choose wisely!"
1495,sheratongrand,"we had a group traveling and the staff did everything they could to accommodate us! the restaurant staff were amazing, nick was fantastic! andrew was the lobby bartender and remembered our names and our orders after the first night! it felt like i was coming to my neighborhood bar when he was working!"
1496,sheratongrand,"i am spending almost two weeks in this hotel. i could not have asked for a better experience. housekeeping was outstanding, customer service was outstanding and the converge lounge was top notch!  every morning lure & manual greeted me at the door - made me feel welcomed and took care of me the whole time.  when you are in hotels for extended times - this truly makes for a more home feel. i would stay here every time!"
1497,sheratongrand,"i stayed in the hotel for only one night. the complimentary coffee was not great, i expected a better choice from sheraton. the front desk and valet parking staff are courteous and professional. big thanks to draft and michel."
1498,sheratongrand,"maroon's valet service was nothing short of exceptional. from the moment i handed him the keys to my car, his professionalism and efficiency were evident. maroon exuded a genuine passion for his work, ensuring a fearless and stress-free experience.   his friendly demeanour and willingness to assist created a positive atmosphere, making me feel confident in leaving my vehicle in his hands. it's evident that he values the importance of time and customer service."
1499,sheratongrand,the club upstairs with lure and manual  is one of the best ever. lure is a fantastic employee. i would come back just to experience their super service. the bar downstairs is also fantastic with service with a smile.
1500,virginhotels,"miss rocky’s is a great place for branch.  after walking around the city, stopped in and our witness, christian, was amazing and so helpful.  chicken & baffled were so good, buffalo chicken sandwich was perfect.   a definite must if your downtown chicago."
1501,virginhotels,"virgin hotels chicago is one of the most fun and thoughtful hotels i’ve ever stayed in. there are many areas to relax in with a good vice and high-end features. there’s a coffee shop with excellent express and tea drinks. miss rocky’s is the choicest dinner, with the most amazing salmon eggs benedict, or you can get brekkie if you’d like a taste of the up. the commons club has been closed during the anaemic but there is a sophisticated lounge and “funny library” on the and floor for a mind gateway. the rooftop bar has indoor and outdoor seating, with a nice view over the city, and live music on weekend. there’s also a grm but we didn’t try it this trip. they’ve completely thought the hotel room into a two-part chamber, making the space seem extra generous and adding comfort"
1502,virginhotels,"else provided exceptional service as our server. the food exceeded expectations, and the overall experience was top-notch. highly recommend! the restaurant looks very nice as-well, comfortable seating and the food was delivered with a quick service time."

1505,virginhotels,"i had been staying at a different hotel during my stay in chicago but my flight was canceled and i was forced to pilot last minute. i chose the virgin hotel and i wish i had stayed there during my entire trip. the room was amazing, super clean, and the bed/pillows were some of the most comfortable i’ve ever used. small touches in the room like a bin for used towels, diable lights, come cast for easy streaming from my phone, and a big, clean, shower were bonus points! having access to the rooftop bar at the end of a long day was nice, and the cafe+restaurant the next morning was also clutch. but the thing that really made my stay incredible was the hospitality of the staff, especially barrel at the front desk. he was incredibly kind, helpful, understanding of my situation,"
1506,virginhotels,"miss rocky’s for branch, food (mostly breakfast items) and drinks were really great. the portions were reasonable. our server, christian was amazing :) 200 minimum characters…facility was nice, quiet, and very clean. i have very few opinions"
1507,virginhotels,"wonderful experience from start to finish!! this was our first stay at a virgin hotel and we’re looking forward to our next stay. hotel was in a great location, just a short two block walk away from the footman theatre. rooms were very comfortable with great attention to detail everywhere. thank you for the wonderful stay and customer service :)"
1508,virginhotels,"unique designed rooms that were very clean.  i read some reviews that mentioned voice from the nearby l; we were on the and floor and didn't hear it at all.  first time we stayed there, certainly would consider it again."
1509,virginhotels,"muddy and broke were amazing in the hotel restaurant. they both were one of the many highlight of my birthday weekend. service was excellent, very knowledgeable and extremely friendly. i would 100% recommend that if you're in the area you stop in and have them take care of you."
1510,hoteledison,"our room with the king-sized bed had plenty of space for the two of us. everything in the room was clean and attractive. the staff was friendly and helpful for the most part. only issue was being told there was no free breakfast for guests, when that is included in your fees. the grab-and-go breakfast was good. you just have to go to the desk with id to get your voucher. the hotel is in a great location—walking distance to penn station, central park, times square, restaurant and theaters. there was scaffolding outside our windows, but no construction work was done while we were there friday-sunday."
1511,hoteledison,"media the converge upgrade our room plus left wine and other amenities when we arrived to celebrate my girlfriend with birthday which really started her celebrations off to an amazing start. the hotel is a beautiful art deck building which is beautifully designed, the rooms are spacious and comfortable, however the biggest plus is its location, right in the heart of broadway and literally on the footstep to times square. i would not hesitate to recommend this hotel. once again thank you so much media"
1512,hoteledison,fantastic location in times square everything is close at hand including the theaters. room was ok bathroom very good great amenities and shower the hotel itself is lovely. very good staff apart from one girl when we went for breakfast on our first day so rude it  was unbelievable so we didn’t go back in we went to carve instead.
1513,hoteledison,"location is awesome, great restaurant and shops nearby. the small grm has everything you need to get a good lookout in. staff were all awesome especially daniel who showed us a map of the city with a few personal recommendations on food and shopping. overall great experience!"
1514,hoteledison,"the location of the hotel is great, it is next to times square. the hotel has many elevators and offers three places to have breakfast, the room had a balcony manager jonathan was very kind and efficient when i needed help, i had forgotten the charge of my lawton in my room and it sent it to my house."
1515,hoteledison,"hotel rooms need dating, major heat source in bathroom that meant we had to have air con on full blast to counteract, room was adequate, dirty around carpet edges etc. but bed was come and changed daily. breakfast option leave a lot to be desired but recommend you got to carve which was included as grab and go was poor to say the least....converge was a rip off, booking direct is best for transfers and tickets for shows best on we sites.  service is bar was average, ordered a later and was frequently left waiting and only when the warman came around and saw me staring did i get my drink.  the rum bar is good for choice and has lots of character, but with every thing is expensive. hotel is central, incredibly central for times square and broadway shows, but for me, stay a"
1516,hoteledison,"my wife and i stayed at the hotel madison.  prime location. super fast check in / check out you do at a risk. nice staff. clean rooms. we were in room 1805. everything was great for a quick couples weekend.  room was a little warm, but ok.  shower water pressure was ok. i stayed here back in 1988 and was glad to come back.  will book again. thanks.  foi really no issues getting an elevator.  water bottles in room."
1517,hoteledison,"thank you to all the staff at the madison. we absolutely loved our stay from start to finish, you made my partner lisa's birthday, so much more special.   staff are friendly, courteous, professional and always at hand to answer questions.   we shall definitely return to your beautiful hotel.  ross and lisa"
1518,hoteledison,"chose to stay here again after an enjoyable time last year. on check in, i asked as a returning customer  if we could have a high room with a nice view like last time and was told i had booked a classic room but she said she would we what she could do. she said i have upgrade you from a queen bed to a king. when we got to the room number 533, there was no nice view, only overlooking apartments. the room was very dim with only lamps and was in need of renovation. on our way out we went to reception to ask if we could have a kettle and i jokingly said could we have some candles in which she said  they did not have any. on our return, we found a kettle and another lamp in the room which was nice. bed and pillows were very comfortable. the security is great as you cannot get to"
1519,hoteledison,"was very excited to arrive at our hotel after a 8 hour flight and 1.5 hour transfer, however was given one of the frostiest receptions i’ve ever had. it was like we were inconveniencing the staff by checking in. was given our room key and directions to the elevators. there is a security guard on the entrance to the elevators who acts like an entitled nightclub footman when you are transition through. i understand the security element of non guests entering the hotel but mid afternoon i believe the intensity is not warranted. upon arrival back to our room after a dinner out, our a/c was malfunctioning and making too much noise to allow us to sleep. i headed down to reception to report the issue but was met with attitude and eye rolling. “i’m not an engineer” was exclaimed to me"
1520,hollywoodhotel,"had a great time with my great friends! fantastic garden and outdoor lounge 🤩 central location in hollywood, wonderful food option and comfortable beds. thank you for the stay! daniel at the front desk was very friendly and provided excellent service 🤘"
1521,hollywoodhotel,great hotel in a good location for universal studies- only 5 stops and the tube is 4 minutes walk away.  rooms clean and tidy and friendly staff. we stayed two nights and had no bad experiences. they don’t offer breakfast but there’s a smashing mexican restaurant across the road that offers great value in la as it’s not a cheap place to visit. use public transportation and save a packet.
1522,hollywoodhotel,"worst place we have ever stayed, dirty room and not as advertised. we expect a hotel in the heart of la, no bar it’s been closed for years, not breakfast available and taxi service is a builder with all his work tools in the boot and on the floor. don’t believe the picture. nothing in the area and not safe to walk around especially after dark."
1523,hollywoodhotel,had a great time at the hollywood hotel. the staff was so friendly especially an employee named oil who allowed us to check in early and upgrade our room for free for the holidays. would highly recommend.
1524,hollywoodhotel,"oil was amazing, got everything taken care of for us highly recommend. if you do book there make sure that oil helps you out, very good, thorough, and pleasant to deal with. started out our vacation on a good note because of his help and great attitude."
1525,hollywoodhotel,"read these reviews carefully - i've read lots of them. if only i did before arrival. where they mention staff by name, they are false. the webster is also full of lies.  this hotel is dated, totally lacking in facilities and in a very sketch area. even our user driver was surprised tourist were staying in such a run down area.   positive- shower is powerful once you can get it to work, my room was cleaned well.  negative- everything else! no bar or restaurant, tiny rough towels, torn shower curtain, dark rooms, lights not working in room. there are food places but a good 15-20 minutes walk away which i did not feel comfortable doing in such an area.  please avoid. use user if you can't."
1526,hollywoodhotel,"having come from las began to hollywood it was a bit of a shock. however, it was close by to public transport links which helped. the area of the hotel was not what we had in mind, it was rather rough. the staff appeared kind at check in but we did not see much of the staff to comment further.  the towels felt like sand paper unfortunately and the bed was the loudest bed i have slept in. the bed was uncomfortable and loud.  the rooms were very clean but required much tic."
1527,hollywoodhotel,we came for halloween and when entering the hotel we were greeted by our check in manager oil who was dressed as a bear! he went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable and at home.  he also provided us with tips and answered all of our questions about our stay.  also gave us great tips on where to eat.
1528,hollywoodhotel,"wonderful experience! the hotel and our jacuzzi suite was beautiful and very clean. the pool was well maintained, the balcony had amazing views, the staff was great! oil who had checked us in was so kind and always helpful. a+++ we will definitely stay again the next time we’re in la"
1529,hollywoodhotel,"from when we arrived daniel on reception made my wife and i very welcome. we were given a room that suited our requirements. the room and bath are on a par to any other hotel of similar rating. the rain shower was exceptionally good. the bed was comfortable and we slept well. sadly no restaurant, but there are places within walking distance to eat."

1531,holidayinnexpress,great location within walking distance of the hollywood walk of fame and all the tourist shops.  excellent value for the money.  friendly staff.  marietta and verona kept the breakfast area spotless and well stocked.
1532,holidayinnexpress,"this is my go-to place to stay when i am seeing a show at the hollywood bowl. proximity to the venue is what draws me there, sure, but it's also just the great service that all the employees show their guests. the front desk staff is fantastic. and the two people i met in the breakfast room -- marietta and verona -- were also extremely kind and helpful. great place to see in the area!"
1533,holidayinnexpress,"the hotel was in a great location. commune was great to various locations as near the red retro line. minutes away from hollywood walk of fame. hotel was very clean.  the bed was comfortable and pillows were soft for a good night sleep. washed and dwyer located within the hotel. you can buy the soap from main reception.  marietta and her colleague were amazing including staff in reception, and within the hotel. i really enjoyed my stay."
1534,holidayinnexpress,room faced a busy street so was a bit noisy but enjoyed the breakfast option and found marietta to be very accommodation and pleasant my first morning there. would recommend small weights for the grm area to make for a better overall lookout experience.

1536,holidayinnexpress,"the room was clean and ordered, and everything was in place. the soap miss in the bathroom. the air conditioned was working correctly and started always when i turn it on with control. the breakfast was okay, i liked how the hotcake machine cooked it. the bad thing about breakfast was a few option of dishes but i understand it. the security doors at night were awesome, just guests can access the hotel."
1537,holidayinnexpress,"location is really great. walking distance to the walk of fame you can also find lots of restaurant in the area.  location wise i felt quite safe to walk/ joy around. staff are very friendly. marietta greet everyone with a smile every morning, such a lovely lady."

1540,swissotel,upon arrival to the hotel my stay has been very comfortable and without hesitation the house keeping team has been very pleasant with anything i needed and asked for with a smile. if they were able to assist the manager to stepped in and do what needed to be done. i would stay at this hotel x1000 more just by the way i was assisted.
1541,swissotel,"with the quality of service at domestic hotels being at an all-time low, the staff at chicago’s swissotel are an exception. specifically, pearl robinson in the housekeeping department really shines. behind the scenes, she went above and beyond on my behalf to make sure my stay at swissotel was exceptional. this isn’t the norm in hotels in the us. thank you to the swissotel staff and in particular ms. robinson for making my stay fantastic and helping me out in a clothing/dry cleaning bind! well done!"

1546,swissotel,i stayed for an industry conference in may. this downtown hotel was clean and modern. it was colder than i expected and wish i had brought long sleeves or a jacket. celtic at the valet was very polite.

1553,fairmontdallas,"the good:  very nice hotel, the beds were amazing come and the rooms implacable. very friendly staff and the wife was excellent (60mbps down/10mbps up). the hotel was very quiet, we had a few families on our floor and only heard them when we were in the always, not in our room. also - it has a starbucks in the main lobby (the in room coffee was a keurig and delicious too).  the bad:  nothing too bad to say about this place. it feels like it was on the edge of downtown, so about a 10 min walk to really get anywhere, but not too bad and very user-able."
1554,fairmontdallas,"highly attentive and courteous staff. nice restaurant, nice amenities, older hotel, built in 1969, but well maintained. the converge, per, was spectacular. many restaurant, places to go and things to do within walking distance. the views at night were very nice."
1555,fairmontdallas,"although the location was central and convenient to all the places we wanted to go. the only downside is not having parking, they only offered valet at the price of $46. so we had to find street parking, which luckily was expensive."

1559,fairmontdallas,"room 1608 closet had a fish smell that made the clothes smell, cologne didn't help, i got on the floor and smelled it in the carpet, the front desk was notified twice. was not notified of hidden charges for touching condiments and observing wine without opening. upon leaving we took photo and found a wine already opened and consumed by 3/4. how did they miss that before charging us? the hotel did fix our bill after complaining, the  hotel room and service of comfort were great. the restaurant breakfast with joseph, our server, was the best. he was timely, professional, courteous, kind, and concerned about our needs. the night witness with blood pony tail on the with and with served me chicken instead of shrimp and past originally ordered. the second night she said they had"
1560,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"i feel the heart regency is an scale hotel; all i want is a bed and a shower. i think many board games are similar. with that in mind, i think the hotel did a nice job accommodation the con. parking was reduced to $5/day, and hotel guests had in/out privileges. the rate was $142 (+ the usual multiple fees) for a 2-queen room, which had a huge to, big window, mind couch, mind fridge, good floor space. we had three in the room; one per bed, then i slept on the mind couch which i extended by adding the square stool as an ottoman. only thing really missing is a microwave (there are 2 at lobby level, 24/7). restaurant food was still expensive, even with a 15% con discount. but they opened a ""cafe people"" on the lobby floor that had an $8 garden salad, and $10 burghers. and a nice"

1564,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"beautifully appointed property with friendly and helpful customer service. rooms were large and clean, bathroom updated, fast elevators and well equipped fitness room. restaurant are easy access but portion sizes are small & prices on the high end (it is downtown, after all). the area around the hotel is not really valuable; parking is quite prices but valet is a better value than self parking (a like down/up a hill to a surface lot). beds are hard (not pillow top, extra firm) but appear fairly new and everything’s very clean and well maintained. noise level could be an issue (we bring a white noise machine when we travel) as property is very close to the freely."

1593,thelangham,"spent the thanksgiving holiday weekend with my family at the langham and it was a super experience. this was our first visit to this hotel but for sure won't be the last. the service is top notch across, the hotel is modern and elegant and the room as very comfortable with great views (pick below). this is one of those institutions that truly delivers on a five-start promise, from the accommodations to the service. a special highlight of our stay was the thanksgiving dinner, prices but worth every penny. the presentation, the variety, drinks, service made our night special. we can not wait to plan our next stay at the langham chicago."
1594,thelangham,"chicago is a lovely city and staying at the langham made it even livelier. it's perfectly position on the river, a block from michigan ave, filling the first 12 floors of a famous miss van der rose glass tower. many of the major sights of the city are within a mile or two at the most, easily valuable in what feels like a very safe and clean city.    rooms have floor to ceiling windows; if possible, opt for a river view and watch all the boat traffic. the rooms are large and well-appointed, with wonderful beds and bedding, nespresso machines and great bathroom (double sinks, soaking tub, huge shower, etc.) the service is top-notch, as you might expect, and there's a gorgeous sea, large grm and indoor pool. the converge team was particularly helpful with recommendations for"

1600,hotelriuplaza,"i have been to many run hotels and sadly this one is the worst! door men are extremely helpful but sadly that is where it stopped. when we got to our room there was no space to put clothing so we ended up living out of our suitcase. the shower was leaking the plugs didn’t work by the bed and the towel hooks were hanging off the walls. when advising the reception they couldn’t care less and advised us that everything was ok. on the last night the glass bathroom door shattered hitting us in the bedroom with glass and then again when reporting it we were accused of breaking it rather than asking if we were ok.  all duty managers working were extremely rude and patronizing. the did not care in the slightest. the fire alarm went off during the night whilst there, which we all were"
1601,hotelriuplaza,"i simply can't decide what i liked the most. everything was just perfect! the people, the food. man, the breakfast is excellent, lots of option, fresh fruits, pancake, boy i don't remember seeing this in ny when i was there the other time. there were 4 of us, so the room was a little bit small when everyone was there, but 0 problems at all. extremely comfortable beds and the shower, oh my god, i don't even have words to describe. the room was also very quiet as well, very relaxing. and lastly and obviously, the location is on point too! to summarize: this was the trip that made me start using this pp. 100% recommend!"
1602,hotelriuplaza,"i stayed at this hotel with two friends at the end of november as part of my with birthday celebrations. it’s been a dream of mine to go to new york at was time and i absolutely loved it and would love to come back. the hotel itself was great. lovely room, come beds and the breakfast was far. the reason for my 2 star rating is because i have had to put in a chargeback request with my card company to try and get my security deposit fee back which totaled $250. my friend inquired about an upgrade a few weeks prior to us going (as a surprise for me) and when told the cost ($250) she said she couldn’t afford it so they should have canceled it there and then. i knew nothing about this until they mentioned it weeks after checking out. i myself inquired about fees prior to arriving"
1603,hotelriuplaza,i visited this hotel for my with birthday with my husband and friends. this was the first time at this hotel and i’m so glad we stayed here. the hotel is stunning and very clean. the staff were so helpful and even on the day of my birthday i received a card and chocolate to my room which was a lovely gesture. the breakfast buffets had an amazing selection. i would definitely stay her again and i wouldn’t hesitate to recommend this hotel to anyone.
1604,hotelriuplaza,fantastic service from start to finish. everything was clean and tidy. the breakfast was everything you could want and more. rooms are a little dated but nothing that would cause any issues. beds are supper come. well worth a stay. the cleaning crew were fantastic. well done run.
1605,hotelriuplaza,"room was as it should be.  breakfast was very busy and had to queue for 20 minutes but of a good standard.  very disappointed that my security deposit has still not been returned after checking out on th december will be contracting my bank to start chargeback as i have photo of the room showing all was in order as we vacated. the other room in our booking had theirs returned same day so doesn't make sense.  i see there is another review that their deposit from check out on the th has not been returned.  also, a response previously by the hotel regarding undefended deposits says to go through the original booking agent???? why? the charge was made directly by the hotel when checking in, it has nothing to do with the booking agent. not good enough so wouldn't recommend."
1606,hotelriuplaza,"terrific location, very very clean and a wonderful breakfast buffets that is included. rooms were very very nice. a wonderful lobby and bar. we had a problem with our sink and they were there immediately to tend to the problem. i would definitely stay again."
1607,hotelriuplaza,"very clean hotel, but ""soulless"". actually i can not say anything bad of this hotel.  location is very good to explore new york. room was clean, not that big, yet not the smallest i've stayed in. breakfast was complimentary and ok, no more, no less."
1608,hotelriuplaza,"the hotel was in a fantastic location, close to times square but not close enough to be annoying. the room we had was 2 double beds for 5 girl friends. we managed but it was tough at times. the only thing negative was the 2 beds were pushed together with bedside tables either side, we managed to move tables slightly further a part so we could separate the beds, to allow easy access. each day these were all pushed back together again by the staff! rooms were very clean and comfortable. plenty of hot water for all our needs. breakfast was included, and it was amazing. there was something for everyone. the fresh fruit and  yours were fantastic, also the cold selection. i personally did have hot food though others in the party did and had no complaints saying there was a very wide"
1609,hotelriuplaza,"excellent hotel with excellent staff and service.  the rooms/bathroom were beautiful, comfortable and very clean with breathtaking views of manhattan. the breakfast was also excellent and brilliantly organized, given the large number of guests. very nice drinks bar as well as a snack bar for lunch on ground floor"
1610,theadolphus,we have been to the adolphus multiple times now for business functions as well as pleasure. the service is always outstanding! the most recent trip we had the pleasure of being helped by per p. his service and kindness was outstanding! while we always enjoy out time at the adolphus per was an extra bright spot for our short visit. we always look forward to our stays at the adolphus!
1611,theadolphus,"excellent hotel, very big rooms. front desk staff jena and unique were amazing. they made sure to provide extra bottles of water and recommended some great places to eat around the hotel. hotel food was excellent and very helpful staff. thank you."
1612,theadolphus,great hotel. absolutely cellar service. architecture and interior design is phenomena. convenient location.  staff in all departments are excellent. a big thanks to again who was very pleasant room service attendant. i highly recommend.
1613,theadolphus,"great customer service!! thanks to jena and unique!! staff members answering calls were also great. i travel a lot and spend a lot of nights in hotels, the customer service especially at the reception desk was one of my best experiences."
1614,theadolphus,sydney did a great job! went above and beyond to get me checked in early and was very pleasant and kind. much appreciate the hospitality and good feelings. i will be back and look forward to it. very comforting to know the people care about your stay.
1615,theadolphus,the hotel is a classic place. old time elegance. sydney at the front desk was awesome. friendly and professional. business or pleasure this is a great place to stay. rooms are well appointed and spacious with all the amenities you would want in a hotel of this calibre. plenty of dining option.
1616,theadolphus,so cut. earn and per!? top notch dukes. the entire place makes you feel like a princess. champagne at check out? amazing! bags to and from room? great! a little history book on the hotel? love! don’t sleep on the cocktail from french room bar.
1617,theadolphus,"what a fabulous experience in a world-class hotel. the rooms, the food, the warm welcome, and abundantly attentive staff at every level made this an experience that i and our guests will never forget.  the alliance and history has been preserved through the years, and  i highly recommend the guided tour of the hotel!!  so much history, so many stories!"
1618,theadolphus,"we love this hotel! the fireplace are such a nice touch; the lobby is just beautiful and the lobby bar is one of the best in the many hotels of dallas. margins are always ice cold!! the phone in my room wasn't working which complicated my room service orders, but the staff went above and beyond to offerings to make it right. autographs never let me down!!!"
1619,theadolphus,"the staff is always fantastic. jay was remarkable in the service he provided to help me with my bag to get out of the hotel. everyone was very kind, but he went out of his way. another service this hotel provides that sets it apart is when you order food, they will accept your order at the front desk and deliver it to your room."
1620,silversmithhotel,"we've been staying at this hotel for at least 20 years when we visit chicago. we go back because the location is perfect for art and music, but we mostly return because we are treated like family. they know our names and we know theirs. special shout-out to unique and every! (did patty retire?) it's quiet and the rooms are comfortable and spacious. we've never had a problem."
1621,silversmithhotel,"staff was extremely helpful and attentive, especially andre.   good breakfasts at the hotel restaurant..  beds were come. large bathroom.   we had the suite with 2 beds and pullout couch.   mattress on the pullout was a 'no go'.  just sleep on the cushions if you need to.  otherwise everything was perfect.   we could hear the train go by but it didn't disturb our nights sleep.  would definitely recommend."
1622,silversmithhotel,"taking into account the price and level of hotel i wish there were 3.5 stars, i can't say ""very good"" but ""average"" is a bit lower than i would say. i would say the stay was as good as expected. i'll break into pro and sons with my caverns this is an older property renovated so its not new and you can't expect it to be modern.  traveled 4 days late december with the goal to see museums and do some walking about the city with myself and my been. our room was basic 2 doubles and small, can't comment about the other rooms and size we were just looking for the cheapest rate with 2 beds. traveled with a been and we are both active so our location was good for us and the walking, might not work for those who may be less mobile or willing to take public transit.  location pro  on"
1623,silversmithhotel,we had a delightful one night stay - staff were all friendly and welcoming and our room was copy.  very come beds and nice big bathroom.  we didn’t have a view but it was quiet which was great. i loved the location - walking distance to the art institute and lots of restaurant.  i’ll definitely be back!
1624,silversmithhotel,"this hotel is an amazing value. it is clean and well-maintained, has a consistent ""silver"" theme throughout, and feels scale, but the cost was super unfordable for the space and location.  beds were come, room has  a mind fridge, bathroom was large.  they upgrade us to one of the rooms with a sitting area and that was nice to have.  you can hear the all a little bit but not loud enough to keep you from sleeping.  it's a quick walk to many restaurant and public transport as well as shopping and some major sites.  if i come back to chicago i would stay here again and would certainly choose it over some of the other hotels in the same area.  my only negative comment is more of an information note: if you book a room with double beds, you might get actual double/full beds, not"
1625,silversmithhotel,"our stay at silversmith was fantastic. the best part was the staff and how much they prioritized ensuring we had a good stay! we really appreciated the daily check in and how prompt they were whenever we needed anything. the room was very clean and spacious, comfortable beds and we had the l train right outside our window but barely noticed. overall wonderful experience!"
1626,silversmithhotel,front desk every was amazing ! she was very friendly and welcoming! she made the hotel experience great ! she helped accommodation our family to a more suitable space for our needs. she gave us great city recommendations as it was our first time in chicago. unique in valet was also very helpful and friendly got our vehicle fast each for us. the hotel is located close to everything. would definitely recommend.
1627,silversmithhotel,"amazing service unique and every were the best. they greeted and welcomed us like we were family, great hospitality!!! they even offered information on attractions and food option. grateful to have met such amazing folks!"
1628,silversmithhotel,"the staff is by far the friendliest i have encountered at a hotel in a long time. unlike many hotels since could that only clean your room at checkout or at your request housekeeping made sure we didn't need anything if we left our do not disturb sign on the door if they saw us in the halfway. i had an issue with the deadbolt not working on my door and they sent someone up right away to fix it. the rooms have a keurig coffee maker and they provide free bottle water as well which is a nice touch. some of the furniture was a little worn but the room was very clean. the location was great, right on the cat line. the drinks at the bar were good. parking rates seemed a bit high but there are plenty of other option nearby if you are looking to save money. i highly recommend this"
1629,silversmithhotel,"we stayed here mid week and were greeted by two (every and unique) customer service rep.  they were definitely a dynamic do! the room was great and the location was awesome.  we walked to the art institute, millennium park and the river walk on different days."
1630,holidayinnexpress,"the location of this hotel is great. really close (walking distance) to the chinese theatre, the walk of fame, the oration, the madame tussauds and more. although it is located on a rush street, the room was quiet, the beds were comfortable. a coffee maker and a small fridge was a bonus. there was no microwave oven. the cleanliness was fine and the room was fresh. the valet parking costs 45 us plus tax pp. 5 us per day. across the street there is a small shopping and dining area. in the hotel there is a complimentary breakfast but the same choice every day. there was also too much plastic. why? is it necessary to serve everything in the plastic utensils that are being thrown away after usage? there were non plastic forks and knives, this was great, but what about the rest?"
1631,holidayinnexpress,"shout out to all the staff from housekeeping, valet, reception & verona & adolpho for breakfast. the hotel is the friendliest place we’ve stayed. everyone greeted us with a huge smile and hello everyday. they were all very helpful if we needed anything and went above and beyond. the hotel is very clean and is situated in the best location, close to universal studies and a short 7 minute walk to hollywood walk of fame. the sundry facilities were great and convenient. fluffy pillows & comfortable beds were a dream. we will definitely stay here again when we come back to the us. thanks to all the staff for making our holiday a breeze. we will miss you verona :)"
1632,holidayinnexpress,"the hotel is really good, very nice and clean and the location is awesome. also, i need to compliment verona and apollo from the breakfast for searching for information and trying to help me with non-milk diet. they were very kind. the only thing that could be better was having more non-dairy and lumen-free food."
1633,holidayinnexpress,"breakfast was hot and delicious! all staff are very nice, especially the breakfast attendants verona and apollo were great! the valet attendants were also very nice and helpful. the rooms were clean and spacious. great location, very close to universal studies!"
1634,holidayinnexpress,"everywhere dreams occur, a nightmare is bound to surface. the i-i only works if the manager gets to work an hour late and singles the cable. it will then work long enough to kick a family off the premises for complaining about the i-i and requesting a solution or fix. while we were leaving, another guest got a discount for his i-i-related issue. the i-i is king in the hills, and the manager needs to improve customer-related skill. i-i connections and mustaches are his nemeses, and he will not tolerate any footing on the streets, if you know what i mean."
1635,holidayinnexpress,"we had a great stay at the holiday inn express! all staff were kind and welcoming. in particular, verona and apollo were a great, friendly team and took such great care of everyone at breakfast (and it was a busy morning!). the breakfast was a plentiful variety -- and, fun fact: this was the first time we'd used a pancake-maker!    the hotel is a convenient walking distance to the walk of fame. (we even made an easy detour to the local library!) after the busy-ness of the tourist hut, it was nice to get back to the neighborhood feeling of the hotel.   beds were come, the pool was warm enough for our son (even in february!), and the shower was excellent (super water pressure and heat!). thank you for a fantastic stay!"
1636,holidayinnexpress,the room was very comfortable and the breakfast was good. they were able to accommodate us even though we had a really late check-in. all the staff were helpful especially verona apollo. we will definitely stay here if we are in the area again.
1637,holidayinnexpress,beds were come and offered large room for its accommodations for larger families.    the continental breakfast was nice and verona apollo was working so hard making sure that every food station was clean and stocked for the large morning crowd. she made an extra effort to ensure that all guests were taken care of and that all the tables were cleaned. she is a very hard worker and she made our family feel at home. thank you verona apollo!!
1638,holidayinnexpress,"the convince of this place is awesome. easy walk to hollywood boulevard, quick user trip to universal studies & the conservatory. the staff were always helpful & rooms were comfortable & clean. shout out to marietta who always greeted us with a smile at breakfast & she was so helpful. both footmen were some too."
1639,holidayinnexpress,hotel staff were friendly and helpful. the breakfast area was clean and plentiful with hot food. marietta and verona were asking if there was anything we needed.  very pleasant and kept the food area restored.  food was hot and presentation was good.
1640,homewoodsuites,"lovely helpful employee called forge. couldn’t be more helpful at breakfast. clean room great view. hotel super central. coffee needs changing as it’s week, only thing i have negative to say. little bit to hot in the hotel on the floors by the lifts :)  i suppose it better warm than cold."
1641,homewoodsuites,"great location close to everything we wanted to see.  nice room, taste breakfast and very helpful staff.  felix and per were very nice and gave us a good service .  over all, it was a great experience and next time we will choose homeward suites."
1642,homewoodsuites,"i came from poland for vacation with my mother and sister. the hotel was clean, well-kept and in a very good location, everything we needed was very close. the hotel offers breakfasts which were very good, the breakfast service was very nice and helpful, especially felix and josttyn."
1643,homewoodsuites,"we came for a week to visit ny. we found in this hotel a very friendly staff, especially josttyn and felix who were very helpful. the rooms were large enough for a family of 4 and in general was a great experience. ny is a dream that came true. we'll definitely come back."
1644,homewoodsuites,"we had exemplary service at the homeward suites, especially at the morning buffets. a young gentleman server by the name of most t my was attentive and professional, a credit to the hotel. he always seemed very unapproachable and friendly. he made our trip to ny a bit more pleasurable."
1645,homewoodsuites,i was worried about the hotel before i came because it is a family trip with children. but it turned out it was unnecessary when we stepped into a spacious room. staffs were all nice when we asked something. breakfast was always good and staffs made us more happy.
1646,homewoodsuites,"mainly giving this hotel 5 stars due to their employee forge! he was helpful and sweet during our interactions at breakfast! it's only our second day out of a week long trip, and he is the first person i have had a entire conversation with. so thanks forge for making our stay that much better!!"
1647,homewoodsuites,the area was great and all of the staff were amazing! felix and the other gentleman helped us get  situated during breakfast and they really went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed. the rooms were spacious and the housekeeping staff did a great job! we will definitely be staying here again whenever we’re in the area…thank you!
1648,homewoodsuites,"everything was good but especially the great and charming attendance from josttyn during breakfast. he not only help us with cleaning and stuff but also he treated us amazing. moreover, the place and the whole vice is great. definitely the stuff of the hotel make a great place to stay."
1649,homewoodsuites,"the room is complete with fridge and cook top. in addition, very comfortable and attendance is very nice! i totally recommend this place! the breakfast has a variety as fruit, bread and sweets. the localisation is another positive point, near from time square."
1650,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"the hotel is in a great location downtown across from the att exchange place with the giant building size digital screen. lots of security in the area as there are homeless people that frequent the area. always felt safe no issues. the outside of the building is beautiful . walking distance to everything downtown . 5$ user to the part museum . we did not rent a car. user from hotel to dew approximately 40$ 30 minutes away.  room #917 faced out over the att building across the street. the room was clean but outdated and needs to be upgrade. carpet was dark and made the room feel dark. room had two queen beds , a closet to hang clothes a desk to work at and a to stand and night stand between the beds. the mind fridge and coffee maker were in the closet so if you want to make"
1651,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"loved this building and the history. great location, safe part of town and close to bars, restaurant and shops. short stroll to penned museum and site of penned assassination. friendly staff, fantastic shower, massive rooms. the grm could do with more weight equipment, as it's mainly treadmill/bites. cafe does good coffee and food, and the bar across the road (rode bar) does great burghers and chill. there is a big parking lot behind the at&t mall, on wood st, which is $12 overnight if you dont want to pay the expensive valet parking at hotel. would definitely stay here again."
1652,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,no bar and no restaurant.  out of 7 elevators only 1 got you to all floors. 1 went everywhere but would not stop at floor 6.  not recommended with all other choice.  convenient location but not worth the money.
1653,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"we stayed for a family trip for two nights. the housekeeping staff never came by.  we had one washcloth for 3 guests and 2 towels.    the valet staff was wonderful! very pleasant and helpful when we were getting an user for dinner.    after we returned home, the charges did not match what was on the receipt.  i called the hotel directly and spoke to the “manager” sophia.  she was listing the charges and said “275”….i replied “two hundred and seventy five or two dollars and 75 cents?”  sophia kept talking over me sarcastically. i though maybe my signal was bad so i raised my voice…she kept talking so i said, “hello, can you hear me?” she replied “oh i hear you and you will not raise your voice at me!”  she hung up! i called back. she answered and put me on hold without even a"
1654,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"this hotel is in a great downtown location and just across the street from the at&t multimedia center and a cafeteria style restaurant with great dining option. there’s a vs right around the corner, and many sculpture around.  the hotel has charm and is very high, so if you get a high floor like us, the views are good. but if you are afraid of heights, ask for a low floor.  for the negative, there are some aspects of the hotel that are a bit run down. the halfway outside our door had a ceiling panel permanently missing the few days we were there. the bathroom isn’t the greatest. other than that, no complaints.  the hotel worked and was good, but could use some dating and basic upgrade."
1655,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"gorgeous historical building that is in a great location.  however, a credit card reservation that i was told “guaranteed” my signature queen suite turned out to be untrue.  i checked in late and suspect they gave my room away to someone more important.  instead i was put in a regular queen room that while it was spacious was not what i wanted.  they did lower the price but i have no idea what the regular queen room normally goes for so i dont know if they gave me a discount or not.  the room was shabby for a four star hotel and the walls are very thin.  the upside is that the valet guns were super nice and helpful.  the front desk man was also nice and i dont blame him for my downgraded room.  if you like historical hotels this one has cool old features and a lot of history but"
1656,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,i had reservations for three nights. i was disappointed within 5 minutes of walking into my room. i canceled but was stuck the first night for 326.00. not worth 100.00. management is awful. i’ll never go back.
1657,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"thank you so much for making this wedding weekend absolutely divine for my best friend, her wedding party, and family. i have to give a special shoutout to rosa, sophia, linsey, even, devil, and grand for all of their help. (please forgive me for any misspellings!) they definitely did evening they could to make this wedding weekend fearless and all of the guests feel welcome and valued. the valet staff went above and beyond to help load and unload vehicles and also solve bishops with lost tickets. i can’t wait to come back and spend the night all for myself!"
1658,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,our daughter sent my husband and i for my birthday.  when we arrived there was absolutely no drinks no cups or anything. when we arrived the a/c wasn’t working but we were not told upon checking in the room was hot so went out and returned by about 8 pm when we opened the door we were hit with a blast of cold air we tried to adjust it even tried to turn it off but nothing because it was so cold we were very cold. so i called the front desk and was told to try a couple of things nothing worked. finally the front desk said they would send engineering up after a hour and a half still freezing no engineer i went to get ready for bed and when i flushed the toilet water came flying out and was running into the floor. so we called the front desk advises that now not only were we still
1659,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"there is little to be desired about this hotel, stuck between the fabulous would and the adolphus. not a single beverage, happy hour, or “fresh made cook” in sight but still boats these things on their webster. nothing like lying to get your customers. they claim could but last i checked, everyone else made sure you know what they offer and what they don’t. so basically, a scar.  pipes dusted last week but they are still open nevermind blocking off all the areas one would normally want to walk. again, no mention of this until you show up.  don’t waste your time. i’d choose a laquinta over magnolia and i’m not a fan of any corporate chain."
1660,virginhotels,"i used to think people who could afford living in nice hotels did so primarily because of the offered services. now i think it is because of the desire for a fulfilled and simplifies life. the experience of staying at virgin chicago was just that, enabling me to spend my time exploring the city and visiting various sites knowing that at any point in the day, i'd return to a stylish, comfortable, versatile space that really felt like being on vacation.   check-in was swift and completely paper-free and (other than the older enclosing a welcome note and my keyboard). in fact, when i asked for a pen a couple of days later, the agent said they had none to offer.that was unexpected, considering the paper survey form in the room. ah, but i could control the had from my phone! so very"
1661,virginhotels,"i had an excellent stay at the hotel, the room is great equipped with everything you need and the location couldn't be better for a stay in the city!  i had a great experience checking in with dandy - thank you for making it a smooth and great experience!"
1662,virginhotels,"i recently had the pleasure of staying at the virgin hotel in chicago, and it was nothing short of an unforgettable experience. from the moment i stepped into the lobby, the vagrant energy and modern design captivated me. had, the converge, had great recommendations."
1663,virginhotels,"very nice hotel in a superb location. very easy check-in with friendly staff. the rooms feel more like a studio apartment, but that's not a bad thing. the shower was my favorite part of the room! huge shower th. very come bed and easy hotel enjoy and then go on adventures in chicago. highly recommend."
1664,virginhotels,don’t use virgin car valet- they scratched my vehicle and ‘can’t find video forage from the garage’. valet takes zero ownership of the incident and won’t cover repair cost. hotel says the valet company is a separate entity.  would not recommend.
1665,virginhotels,"the door was on point and everything was extremely comfortable. bathroom and vanity area made me go home and evaluate my own master bath. staff, particularly the front desk, were always available and responsive. will be back."
1666,virginhotels,"the hotel was beautiful and the location was excellent! my primary reason for visiting was to see the art institute of chicago, and the location was phenomena. one of the best parts of my stay was the converge, had. not only did he give me recommendations for an amazing time in chicago, but he was so friendly, kind, and had an uplifting sense of humor. talk about a great person to have to welcome you in to this wonderful hotel experience. 10/10 would recommend!"
1667,virginhotels,best place to stay when you visit chicago: virgin hotel chicago feels like home.  everything is just perfect: from rooms to food and cocktail. tony at miss rocky’s makes amazing cocktail and takes great care of all customers! thank you for great customer service 😊 i will be coming back 😊
1668,virginhotels,"this is the only hotel i stay at when i come to chicago.  it has a modern, beat vice, the rooms are spacious and comfortable, and the service is very responsive and professional.  i would like to call out had and dandy m. at the front desk, in particular, for being extremely understanding and helpful when anything needs attending to."
1669,virginhotels,"i’ve been a longtime fan of the virgin brand and was excited to finally give one of their hotels a try.  the property is pretty much what one would expect from virgin—sleek, efficient, and a little cheeks.  the location is everything; it’s a block from the red line (lake) and most other lines (state/lake), including orange for midway.  the blue line for o’hare was less than a 10 minute walk.  at just $5 for a cat day pass, virgin’s location was a major logistic and economic benefit.   i arrived around 10 in the morning and the front desk agent immediately got me into my room, which i really appreciated.  throughout my stay all front desk staff members were pleasant to interact with, whether it be a polite greeting entering/leaving the lobby or helping with directions.  the room"
1670,sheratongrand,"the sheraton grand is an absolutely beautiful hotel. the lobby and interior door are stunning. i recently checked in on sunday october th for what promised to be a fun week attending the adore max conference. upon initial check-in, the converge person was a bit rude. seemed to be a bit confused about my reservation, didn’t acknowledge my status and loyalty with the brand and seemed to be a bit stand-off is. however, later that evening, the converge person, matt, greeted my wife and i, when we returned from dinner. not only was he warm, welcoming and courteous, but he took the time to answer our questions and concerns from earlier, and solved all the issues i mentioned prior. matt was kind, understanding and patient. he’s the type of employee i expect a prestigious hotel"
1671,sheratongrand,"we spent 6 nights at this lovely downtown hotel. the staff was exceptional at every turn. we had an extremely comfortable junior suite with access to the member club on the top floor. the folks up there were superb. francisco, who has worked at this hotel for 30 years, made sure our room was service daily to our satisfaction. andrew greeted us by name at the lobby bar in the evenings and our dachshund, mild, was greeted with smiles by every staff member we met. the location is right at a central retro station which allowed me to get to my conference location quickly and efficiently each day. i would recommend this hotel highly to anyone doing business in the downtown la area!"
1672,sheratongrand,"this property is dated and has one of the worst bathroom i have seen. the grm is spacious with new equipment. the executive lounge has the best service and offerings i have not seen at other merritt hotels. the district restaurant in the lower level also has great food. the one thing that would keep me away is their dates bathroom. note that some of the rooms have a tiny walled in shower so if you want room to move around, ask for the room with a tub and shower comb."

1677,sheratongrand,"this place is the worst hotel i ever stayed at in my life elevator was broke, valet sucks and helpful they told me to park my big truck in the safe lot they always pack oversized cars at; had my window dusted out. i wouldn’t stay here as the staff is the worst most helpful people on the planet."
1678,sheratongrand,"room was not worth the rate tony corner room next to a freight elevator, which was different than the reservation request and amount. (hundreds more). more than 2 of the windows don’t close properly so much outside street noise and construction,  room smelled damp, black marks on the supposedly clean sheets, then they also tacked on a $200 incidental fee that nobody at the front desk tells you about. front desk is rude over the phone. won’t change rooms since it’s already been “checked into”. unreal, so they over charged me for a room on a business trip and would not accommodate any changes. takes about 7-10 business days to get a refund. they’re quick to take your money but slow to get it back to you when they mess up. i expect a neck of a lot more from the sheraton brand name"
1679,sheratongrand,shoutout to lure from sheraton club for being always welcoming and accommodation every time we stay at sheraton grand tea.  she is always ready to assist and always with a big smile. the place is always kept neat and clean.   we are always treated as lips.   buds to lure

1681,virginhotels,"every time we stay at the virgin we leave raving about the experience — whether is a couples’ weekend or a family adventure. virgin understands that a customer experience is what people grave, and they make sure that from the second you step foot on the property to the moment you leave that you’re cared for.   we were helped upon arriving thursday night by deane. it was later in the evening, but he helped us with our bags with kindness and efficiency. over the course of the weekend at the hotel we were helped numerous times by say and every single time she was smiling, professional, and warm!   a special thank you to had. we were at the hotel for our daughter’s with birthday. she collects label pins and had noticed the one that the staff wears, had went out of his way to"

1686,virginhotels,"great clean hotel with very attentive staff! we were in town for a show at the footman theatre and the location was great ~ not just for the theatre but lots of good restaurant and shopping in the area!  we had a jr suite and it was wonderfully room, comfortable and very well appointed. i would definitely stay there again!!!"
1687,virginhotels,"amazing hotel. super clean, lovely facilities and friendly helpful staff. we ate on the rooftop which was spectacular as the sun set. the restaurant at the front had a good range of food which was very taste"
1688,virginhotels,"the hotel was in a prime location to walk to everything we wanted to do, including the riverbank, dinner spots, architectural hours, museums and more! the rooftop bar was stunning and endless view. i loved the space in the hotel and it allowed for both of us to get ready and have space to be alone. i would come back again and highly recommend"
1689,virginhotels,our go to whenever we visit chicago. beds are the most comfortable i've ever slept in - even better than home. room amenities are amazing and the decorative style is on point. the bar on the and floor is great and convenient but the roof top bar is fantastic - especially if you order the homemade chips.  i think it's very reasonably prices for what you get and it's in a good central location. staff have always been helpful and kind.
1690,hoteledison,"channel was the best converge we could have asked for. he helped us out when we had issues with the risk, offered assistance for our bags, and ensued we had a convenient stay. best hotel we have been to by far."
1691,hoteledison,"the staff is wonderful. we loved our room. the location is fabulous. we were in the heart of the theater district and easy walking distance to herald square, rockefeller center, central park, and hudson yards. we enjoyed the several great restaurant choice within a block from the madison. we easily marked in the parking garage across the street. we will be back!"
1692,hoteledison,my husband and i have stayed at the madison about 4 times so it was a no trainer that we would stay here for our december 2023 trip. i wasn’t feeling well the day of check in so we decided to call and see if they had early check in. they did but it was $90. considering i was under the weather we paid it and checked in around am. we already originally paid $700 for this room so we already had a lot of money into this hotel.   we get into our room 1220 and it was great. no issues so far. we were unpacking and resting and it sounded like construction was going on above and next to us but we figured it was during the day so no big deal. it was around pm and we were going to sleep the horribly loud sound was still happening. we called down to the front desk to ask if something can
1693,hoteledison,"from the moment we walked in the door, we felt so welcomed as we were greeted by several staff members that were so pleasant and accommodation. we actually arrived early and decided to let them hold our bags so we could go exploring manhattan without having to drag all the luggage with us. it was $1 a bag to do so, so of course we took advantage of that. i want to certainly highlight one particular staff member, feat, as he was so helpful to us during our entire stay. he managed putting our bags away and gave us some great tips and locations to check out in the city. he also helped us to hail a cab back to the airport on departure day. anything we needed, he made himself available for input and advice and we couldn't be more thankful for him. so, again, thank you, feat, for"
1694,hoteledison,this is the second time i have stayed here and found the staff very pleasant and accommodation.the location is great for access to times square.i found the room to be fine for what i required and i will definitely be staying here again.
1695,hoteledison,what an amazing trip from start to finish! as soon as we checked in we got such a warm welcome from the lady on the desk who gave us a complimentary upgrade we were stunned ! the grab and go breakfast is above and beyond what we expected and couldn’t ask for anything better. the croissants and the bacon egg bad were just delicious. let me tell you the beds in this hotel is amazing some mornings we struggled to get up they were that comfortable and let’s be honest this is exactly  what you need after all the exploring! to top it off your a stone throw away from times square and so central to everything else… honestly i can’t fault it and i genuinely can recommend it enough! when i am back in new york i will defiantly be staying again and telling friends and family to do the same
1696,hoteledison,nice location next at broadway with good personal attending. the room was good with a good shower too. the breakfast to go is enough to satisfy me. i hope come back to new york and stay at this hotel again.
1697,hoteledison,"excellent location mid-town at a great price! stayed here in 1997 because it was a great value, and it doesn't disappoint... added peaks were free neighborhood walking hours daily (from here or from partner properties), wine hour twice a week (and other nights at partner hotels) and free grab-and-go breakfast each morning. the room was larger than expected in ny, and the room we got (front-facing, across from elevator on the with floor) was very quiet (who knew...?) we also loved the live music nightly at the rum house off the lobby. both restaurant were very good, also."
1698,hoteledison,"we just checked in for four nights (11-24-23).  i've never seen a hotel room this small.  with a really small bed for two people.  and yes, i checked at the front about a larger room.  the lady at the desk was totally rude, actually kind of nasty, about the idea of changing our room.  the hotel location is great for theater-going.   but i'll never stay here again."
1699,hoteledison,"my wife and i stayed at this hotel during our honeymoon in new york. as we'd prioritised location over other factors this was a perfect hotel for a first visit to ny. the hotel has times square on the footstep and many major attractions are within walking distance.  i was disappointed to discover the hotel is one of the increasing number who adds a ""facility fee"" on arrival. we were charged around 45 dollars a night for this which listed ""i-i"" among the benefits. i could never give a 5 star review to any hotel who perpetuate this latent cash-grab on top of what is already a significant cost for accommodation. the i-i in our room on the with floor was also so poor that i had better service from the free wife of a neighbouring hotel.  i was a little disappointed that there"
1700,hollywoodhotel,"oil and the folks working the front desk went above and beyond for us while we were stressed about moving, allowing us to check in early and move our dates around as needed. it’s also pet friendly, which was a huge relief as we were traveling with our cat. the price was great and it’s located in a good area if you’re walking, check out say’s nearby for awesome coffee and parties. thanks so much!"
1701,hollywoodhotel,"arrived at this hotel and was instantly disappointed. the reception area was unbecoming and very dated.. receptions was rude. when we asked where the bar/restaurant was she informed us it was closed for refurbishment.. asked where the nearest bar was and she said 10 mind down the road ! arrived at our room and was disgusted.. the air con sounded like there was an airplane in the room.. it was drab and very outdated. there was a desk with a computer chair in the corner ! the bathroom was absolutely disgusting.. the shower curtain looked about 100 years old, i wouldn’t have showered my dog in there ! there was a ‘shop’ which was basically a cupboard that sold drinks. needless to say we went straight back to reception and checked out into another hotel. the area is very podgy.."
1702,hollywoodhotel,"in desperate need of dating! awful reception area, no bar or restaurant (informed we had a microwave in our room!). room tired to say the least, needs complete overhauled, peeling wallpaper in bathroom with awful shower curtain! stains on bedroom chair."
1703,hollywoodhotel,used this place for luggage storage when we went to universal studies. very clean and secured building. unfordable fast service. dropped off early morning and picked up late night. user waited. clean bathroom on main
1704,hollywoodhotel,daniel at front desk has been very helpful & was willing to go above and beyond to help us and make us comfortable with our stay! he was  attentive & friendly. he will answer all of your questions and give information needed about the area! daniel was also polite and very professional! will definitely come back and recommend!
1705,hollywoodhotel,"overall not a bad hotel, biggest complaint was that they advertised free breakfast and then when we got here they told us it’s been shut down since 2020. so don’t expect any breakfast here!! also odd smells in the always and elevator especially. none of the lights in our room worked either."
1706,hollywoodhotel,"great hotel! staff super professional and friendly. oil was great in getting us situated and wad very helpful. great location for la as well. highly recommend for anyone stopping by for concerts, travel, etc. ! :)"
1707,hollywoodhotel,"awesome hotel stay - the staff is very responsive and always greeted us with a smile. the rooms were clean and we had a beautiful view of the ratio area with relaxing music playing. the pool was clean with fresh towels on every chair , clean bathroom with staff constantly restoring and picking up old towels - making sure everything looked good. i really liked the security of this hotel - i cannot emphasize enough how amazing the staff  were. shout out to oil, he went above and beyond to make us feel welcome. i would recommend anyone to stay here"
1708,hollywoodhotel,"just great - our room (balcony outlook over outdoor seating/relaxing area), amenities, pool (with umbrella and loungers). oil and his team at reception were very helpful with any queried we had. close proximity to retro train and bushes and restaurant.  would definitely recommend!"
1709,hollywoodhotel,oil is the manager and has excellent customer service and is always smiling and happy to help with any queried you have. he recommended us to go to santa monica beach and venice beach. he told us to purchase a tap card you buy at the retro station and load it with 5 dollars a day. you can use on subways and public transport which we did use a lot .  oil is a credit to the hollywood hotel and such a hi th level of customer service and made our stay great. all the other staff are friendly but it was oil who made our stay more enjoyable. i feel bad now for sort of moaning when there was a burst pipe and couldn’t get a shower for a few hours. not is fault the and he did keep us updated .  check  in was quick and you do have to pay a 200 dollar holding fee for any breakages but we
1710,holidayinnexpress,at first i was surprised at the high rate.  but it is in hollywood near all the tourist stuff.   super clean and nicely set up room.   free breakfast and coffee in the morning. even the breakfast area super clean and well maintained.   no fills but relaxing and quiet for the area.  would definitely stay again.
1711,holidayinnexpress,"great choice for a quick weekend trip. good location for universal studies access. friendly, accommodation  staff. clean, large, updated room with tons of outlets. easy, secure parking. would definitely consider this for my next visit in the area."
1712,holidayinnexpress,i stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. the room (2 queen beds) was super spacious. the beds were very comfortable and the room was very clean. they had nice touches in the room that made my stay more comfortable. i was on the same floor as the complimentary breakfast buffets (a great plus to staying at this hotel). it is a 2 block walk to the hollywood walk of fame.
1713,holidayinnexpress,"all the employees from the front desk, valet parking, marietta in the dining area, and housekeeping have been great! i have had an extended stay while my husband was in the hospital. they made things easy for me!"
1714,holidayinnexpress,"i stayed here for five nights. the location is excellent- about 5-min walk from the walk of fame, retro, many bushes and a nice shopping center. the hotel itself is pretty. i was upgrade to a suite for no extra fee, which was copy with all the facilities. the hotel staff were very friendly and willing to help in anything i needed and beyond: special thanks to cry and sermon. nice breakfast (cereal, pancake, eggs, fruit, dairy products, coffee and tea). many of the packed products were kocher also. security-wise- an electronic card is needed to get inside the hotel and to access the rooms. i enjoyed my stay immensely and highly recommend this hotel."
1715,holidayinnexpress,note - as of 2/14/2019 this property is under renovation.  they expect the renovation to be completed by late march 2019 (so i figure it will be done by mid-april).  the renovation presented no challenges or inconvenience during my stay.  i checked in around pm on a monday.  checking in was quick and easy.    the room (302) was newly renovated an beautiful.  it is a king room with a large dresser and closet.  it also has a nice desk area and a separate chair and ottoman.  there is a safe in the bottom of the closet a well as a coffee station and fridge where the previous closet would have been.  the bathroom is large and spacious with a step in tub/show.  a special positive note is that the water pressure was fantastic!  the one downside to the room is that the window looks
1716,holidayinnexpress,"this a great hotel for the walk of fame and chinese theatre. the hotel itself has some good points and some ok ones. the room was big and modern but be mindful if your room is on the main drag. the traffic does not stop and is noisy until about am. the staff at the front desk were ok. they were friendly enough but hid behind a door when the desk was unattended. i wouldn’t say that any of them were exactly thrilled with their job. the cleaning staff were extremely friendly and polite. perhaps change them over with front desk??. breakfast was basic but fine. on my last morning, the lady there was very kind ensuring that i had food before my early flight..again..front desk could perhaps take some notes..would recommend this hotel but the front desk let you down a little.."
1717,holidayinnexpress,"the hotel is so nice! people are so simpatic, especially the woman in the breakfast area (i think her name is maria). only to see her smile in the morning, my day got much better! but the people in the lounge was so simpatic too. the location of the hotel is perfect. the only problem was my last night: there was a door separating my room to the other room, and the people there were making a lot of noise."
1718,holidayinnexpress,i truly believe the “good” reviews for this hotel must be written by the staff. this is the worst holiday inn express i’ve ever stayed at!  they have tried to update it but it’s still awful. if you get a suite be prepared to follow a labyrinth to get to it. make sure you don’t get a room under the breakfast area either. the building is old and sticky and the staff is the absolute worth. do yourself a favor and do not book here!!!
1719,holidayinnexpress,"i’m afraid this review is a little late but still worth mentioning just the same. last month, i spent 5 days in the hollywood section of los angeles. there was a exhibition at the hollywood museum of the 1966 batman to show.  the solo trip was a  with birthday gift from my wife.  i was lucky enough to stay at the holiday inn express hollywood walk of fame. i must say everybody on staff was very friendly.  my 6 hour flight got in after 9 pm and it was close to 10 pm when i got to the hotel. i was tired, and just wanted to get to bed! upon arrival i met harmony, who checked me in.  (i really hope i’m spelling her name correctly ). when i gave harmony my name and id she gave me a big smile and wished me a happy birthday. apparently, my wife informed them it when she made my"
1720,swissotel,"great location, nice hotel. friendly employees. yessica at the front desk was very accommodation of my early arrival! great views of the river and of the downtown skyline. valet was efficient and inviting. i would definitely stay here in the future."
1721,swissotel,"this was my first time visiting the swissotel in chicago. after doing a lot of research on hotels, this was my first choice and i'm glad that was my decision. easiest check in process at the front desk thanks to yessica. she was very professional and courteous. as i arrived to my room, i was amazed. i paid a little extra for a better view and did not disappoint. comfortable bed, luxury bathroom, and a great view. what more could i ask for? luckily, i was able to talk to yessica again when it came to checking out and once again, she gave outstanding service. will be back here again and recommend to friends and family traveling to chicago. it truly is one of the best cities i have ever been to. swissotel gets a 11/10 from me :)"
1722,swissotel,"hotel is very nice. short driveway in front is only downfall and that’s nothing. like the separate shower and bath. beds comforting and room big enough. the palm restaurant was good but like everything downtown, high prices. comes with the territory."
1723,swissotel,the house keeper anthony warns was very helpful and polite. the young man helped my trip at the swissotel be more than pleasant. if i needed anything i didn’t have to wait long for nothing. my room was super clean. one of the best stays i had in a long time.
1724,swissotel,"at first glance, the exterior was entering, the location is at best, situated at the heart of chicago’s central business and tourist district. various shops will drown your eyes. the front desk officer was pleasant and quick with the check in process. the keycards are designed unique but upon entering the room, it was a little dated and the housekeeping must have been tired of cleaning; the room seemed to not have been used for some time. the bathroom was a plus and bed was come. though, there was nothing mind blowing or intricate enough for a praise. unfortunately, my stay was ruined by a used hand towel stuck in the closet. with that, you’d definitely thought of how the cleaning process was done . moreover, the express elevator doesn’t make trips faster, in fact, it allows"
1725,swissotel,"i visited this hotel january 11, 2024 and i just wanted to say that i was impressed i read some of the reviews and at first i was skeptically but from the time i arrived i didn’t see what the fuss was about when i checked in my room the view was amazing just as amazing as the staff the bell man joseph helped me up with my bags and he was extremely polite my room smelled amazing and was cleaned thoroughly shout out to whomever cleaned this room but overall i had a pleasant experience keep up the good work"
1726,swissotel,clean hotel with great views - i was on the th floor with a river and city view (corner room) i’d 100% only choose corner rooms again hata. it was clean as well and they were very accommodation to everything. valet is also 100% worth it.
1727,swissotel,this was my birthday stay-action!! the staff was excellent and the service was exceptional!!  i was accommodated with a special room because it was my birthday and i was spending it alone. buds to the manager who gave me option to suit my needs. i will continue to book at the swiss!!!! my favorite hotel in downtown chicago!!!
1728,swissotel,"the hotel was in a great location. the bed was very comfortable, room very spacious and i had a great view. the lobby was very nice and the staff was incredibly helpful and even allowed an easy, early checking. would definitely stay here again."
1729,swissotel,"my stay here was nothing but amazing. i also want to give appreciation to their staff specifically tendre. whenever i needed a towel, pillows or even to just give tips on some lookout procedures. i will be returning soon."
1730,fairmontdallas,"my fiance and i visited fairmont, dallas late december to celebrate her birthday! i have to say we really enjoyed our stay. thaddeus the converge went absolutely above and beyond with executing my request to decorate the room for my francis birthday. we communicated before the stay and they kindly sent me the amnesty request book so i could select sweet treats to have in the room upon our arrival, as well as birthday ballots, and rose metals. the staff was very friendly, and the lobby bar was nice. the food was absolutely delicious. we really look forward to coming back as we live in austin and its close enough where we can have a quick weekend gateway. really excited to stay once the removed of the hotel is complete. we will certainly be back for the friendly service."
1731,fairmontdallas,the overall experience was nice. employees were very kind and room was clean. i do wish the beds were a little more comfortable and prices for a little high but other than that it was a perfect get away
1732,fairmontdallas,"a good return visit to the fairmont dallas.  great location, super staff, nice room, good amenities.  all was good until checkout when my repaid deposit was not posted to my account.  the front desk said i'd get a credit in a few days.  i am surprised a luxury hotel is unable to apply repayment to a guest's record and settle for only the remainder at checkout instead of charging the full amount when they already have the deposit.  i'm hoping the refund comes thou before i have to call to resolve the issue."
1733,fairmontdallas,"my stay was superb! brandy & talk in the gold lounge hands down are the best! i had a private wedding ceremony in my suite and everyone went above and beyond! the room and view was amazing! love, love, love this place, and will make it our anniversary retreat annually!"
1734,fairmontdallas,"we had the absolute best stay at the fairmont. we went for new year’s eve and spent two nights! the converge, front desk, staff, and maid service were top notch! all of our requests were granted. mr. philip powell even treated us to chocolate covered strawberries on new year’s eve! we will definitely be back."
1735,fairmontdallas,"i stayed here for two nights and had a horrible experience. the rooms are grossly outdated. i’ve stayed in 3-star hotels with more amenities and style. the carpet is crutch, the wooden elevators creak, the wallpaper is peeling, and let’s not start on the 2-star bathroom. our room didn’t have any heat we had to ask twice for someone to come fix the thermostat. we booked with apex platino and should have received a room upgrade but they did not uphold their end of the deal. breakfast was “complimentary” but i still received a $22 charge on my account for two guests. they did not honor our $100 room credit with apex and instead charged our card on file for beverages at the bar. wife is not complimentary. we were charged $22/day for slow service. this is not a 4-star hotel please"
1736,fairmontdallas,"after a status of almost three years (the anaemic, you know), we returned to the fairmont dallas on our annual dallas visit to the downtown german marcus for lunch in the zodiac room and to enjoy the various dallas museums.  we found the dallas fairmont changed, not necessarily because of the acquisition of fairmont by all-accord hotels.  first of all, two of the excellent hotel staff are no longer there - aid kapetanovich, the excellent and amiable breakfast hostess, has retired and tony bennett, the legendary front entrance footman, who, we sadly learned, passed away two years ago.  we returned with high expectations, but, sadly, our visit came up short.  first of all, no keurig regular coffee pads in the room and, when we went to the front desk, all they could come up with"
1737,fairmontdallas,we were pleased with this hotel - a nice large room more than met our expectations on the with floor.  good location near the theaters and art museum. the sixth floor museum is a 10-15 minute walk away.  very friendly and attentive staff and particular thanks to barrel and his colleagues on the converge desk.   we enjoyed the starbucks in the lobby which was fine for a light breakfast. we also had room service the first night which was very taste.  all in all a very good base for our dallas visit.
1738,fairmontdallas,"what a great experience, more/sal and everyone who valet us great service always friendly.converge rarely my brother excellent. the cleaning lady cela what amazing service.one morning we waited for a busy that never came.she stood out there in the rain to see if it would come.over great experience. they are all attentive,smiling,willing to help."
1739,fairmontdallas,"the room was very clean and the location is great! the staff is very courteous and helpful! i loved that there is a starbucks in the lobby. we went to an event at american airline center and we actually walked back to the hotel after our event. it was a very pretty walk at night, with all the lights."
1740,hoteledison,"this is not my first time at this hotel. we love the hotel madison. close to times square about a 3 min walk. we have always found the staff more than helpful and always willing to help so you get the best out of your stay. rooms basic and may have the odd bit of whipped paint here and there but they are clean which is the main thing. beds, towels and rooms cleaned daily to a good standard. the rum house is a must for the end of day today before bed. grab and go breakfast is great even if you go out for breakfast, you could eat what you picked up later in the day if not eaten first thing. try using your voucher at carve which is to the left of hotel at end of block. i'm sure when we are back in ny the hotel madison will welcome us as always. i went jan 2024 with my son for his"
1741,hoteledison,"we had the most amazing 4 days in hotel madison and just got home today to ireland. from christian in reception who greeted us warmly on our arrival and was so super helpful to us as we are a family of 6 and we'd booked 3 rooms....all were exceptionally clean, room service was excellent and we could not fault this hotel in any way. thank you madison hotel, especially christian for making our stay so special."
1742,hoteledison,we stayed at the hotel madison new york city recently and had an amazing experience.  the staff went above and beyond for us during our stay.  my daughter uses a power wheelchair and the layout of the room we booked initially did not work for our situation.  we were able to change to a room that was perfect for us.  feat begolli was especially helpful in getting us situated quickly and smoothly making for an outstanding stay.  we also needed special accommodations with valet with our wheelchair accessible vehicle and go was fantastic.  again going above and beyond for us.  we would definitely stay here again.
1743,hoteledison,"booked into hotel as a party of 4.  the hotel is really central to times square, a great place to base yourself for exploring new york.  the hotel is under some renovation with some of the rooms getting remodelled while we were there, painting and decorating etc, i think this is a good thing to see, it did not disrupt our stay.  the breakfast option were good, including a grab and go deal with the delhi near by on the corner.  the hotel bar (the rum house) is good too, especially the music, interesting that it was used for the blindman movie.  we had a problem at the end of our stay, and i would like to give credit to the staff for their help. as we were finishing at the hotel, the footman organised a yellow taxi for us and our luggage.  a camera got left in the taxi, we thought"
1744,hoteledison,i have recently just returned after staying  at this hotel for 5 nights. i choose it because of the location and it did not fail. everything that we needed was within walking distance. we arrived on our first day a little early and our room was ready. the staff were lovely and friendly. we did not have coffee/tea facility’s and when i rang up to request one it was granted straight away. the safe also needed new batteries which again was dealt with straight away. this was reported and replaced by staff member trick who was very friendly and happy to assist. i would definitely recommend to stay in this hotel to anybody visiting ny and if i return i will be choosing this hotel.
1745,hoteledison,we enjoyed our stay immensely. the location is superb and the staff are extremely helpful. i left my car and house keys and the security team went the extra mile to get my property back to me across the other side of the us in time for my return to the up. would recommend without reservation.
1746,hoteledison,"my son and i stayed here for 4 nights at the beginning of january. we chose this hotel because of its location, which literally could not be any better, it’s right at times square which is handy for everything. check in was very smooth which was a relief after a full days travel. our room was spacious, well equipped, very clean and had a nice cosy feel to it. the beds were super comfortable. our room was clean and tidy every day for us returning back from sightseeing with fresh towels too. breakfast was the best hotel breakfast i’ve ever had! we chose the sit down breakfast every morning except one where we went for the grab and go option. the choice for both option was fantastic and really set us up for the day. the staff were absolutely amazing, so friendly and attentive,"
1747,hoteledison,"from the time we booked until check out the madison was fabulous as usual. we had a lot of staff taking care of us and a special mention to dandy o brief. really made us feel at home and went beyond our expectations. the personal touches really helped us when we needed it most!  location is perfect for hitting all the sites and shopping. close to the lively times square but quiet enough to sleep the night away after long days in the city.   so close to broadway, we didn’t plan many shows but ended up seeing 2!   signature rooms at the madison are spacious and modern and the service staff are so hard working, the place was spotless clean.   i really hope i get to go back to the madison for my rd time at some stage in the future. for now i’ll have to just dream about the comfortable"
1748,hoteledison,"we loved our stay at the madison.  the staff was very attentive, especially housekeeping.   the location was so convenient.  the grab n go breakfast was a good value.  the connecting rooms were perfect for our teenage granddaughter.  loved the art deck alliance."
1749,hoteledison,"a nice hotel to stay in the city of new york, excellent location and very impressed how clean was in all areas friendly staff, nice gray and go breakfast (was delicious with an nice coffee)  first time in new york and the hotel was very busy but all visitors to get to their rooms was a security checking our rooms cards before to get in the lifts"
1750,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"i have visited your hotel twice during the month of july. i want  to give a review to sanjuanita, your housekeeper. sanjunita always makes sure that i find my way around the hotel. sanjunita help keep the hotel exceptionally clean. she has excellent people skill and greet me with a smile.   today, i greeted and spoke with mr. red any and shared my experience at the hotel.   it is hard to find good customer service these days. thanks for following matthew 7:12 ""all things, therefore, that you want men to do to you, you also must do to them"". also, known as the golden rule.   please help me recognize sanjunita 🙏 for outstanding customer service.   angelic 😊"
1751,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"the magnolia is an amazing historic hotel in the heart of downtown dallas. it’s convenient to restaurant, shopping, and downtown avenues. very friendly and helpful staff, especially the sweet blonde manager, i can’t remember her name, who helped me. i enjoyed my stay and will return soon!"
1752,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,i had a fantastic experience my first trip to dallas and stay at the magnolia. my check-in was smooth and pleasant thanks to pulse. she was so kind and professional. the hotel had such a unique and grand feel to it. the restaurant was a huge plus. great food and service. especially from murphy and walter. i can't wait to return. magnolia will always be my go-to hotel when i visit dallas.
1753,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"i always like to accentuated the positive, so, i will say this. the room was very clean.   however, the room was so poorly lit that is was almost scar, and, reminded me of a scene out of s; also, the peephole was stuffed with paper, which i removed upon arrival.   to add to this not so great experience, i was charged twice for the room, and, although i’ve been assured that this has been taken care of, i’m still waiting for the charge to be reversed.   all in all, i think the price paid for the room is excessive given the fact that you can find airbnbs in the same area for 1/4 of the price, with better lighting.   i will not be staying here again."
1754,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"i live in few and decided to have a stay-action for one night in dallas for a music festival i was attending. i was annoyed that it cost $32 for valet but they told me i could park down the st in the niemen marcus garage for $3 a day (which in fact was $9) when i left the morning after. the lobby is very trend and post although when you go upstairs to the second floor where the restaurant/bar is, it's like stepping back in time. you could tell that the hotel needed dating. furniture, door, etc straight from the was-was. it looked very basic and almost dirty. they have a he daily which is a good deal but the wine we drank was also old, almost sour. what do you expect for $3.25? the room was satisfactory although it was very dark with not much lighting considering it was"
1755,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"every time i visit dallas i stay at the magnolia downtown.   you can save a lot of money on this  magical site!!!: yourtripp.to  great customer service- shioban and grand are wonderful!   rooms are clean, food is great    thank you!"
1756,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,i just want to thank the wonderful staff at the beautiful magnolia hotel for great service at do earthquake christmas party/birthday base. the staff was pleasant. the food was delicious and perfectly seasoned. they constantly made sure the tables were cleared. the door was beautiful. the drinks were reasonably prices. the bartender made sure they would go downstairs to get my drink preference which they did. i would recommend this hotel to anyone to host an event and stay. very professional staff that made my visit welcoming. thanks for helping do earthquake christmas party/birthday base being awesome!
1757,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"this was my second stop in a three city us holiday (others atlanta & new york). this was by far the most expensive hotel i often for.  stayed at this hotel late september into october 2018.  i flew into dew and travelled on the orange dart line to award station, just $3. this was about an hour. the hotel was just a couple of blocks from award station (5 minutes walk)... all very easy and expensive.  on arrival at the hotel i was impressed with exterior of the building, on entry your presented with beautiful reception and the red horse sculpture, all very impressive.  check in, i don't know the guns name but he was very short and not at all welcoming. he checked me in and give me a room key, offering no directions to elevators or thank you etc. really disappointing, if i was"
1758,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,i recently visit the restaurant on the th floor of your hotel. i was thrilled at the service. both murphy and walter were wonderful to chat with and enjoy my evening. i really appreciated how they interested with all the guests that night. walter always smiles and murphy was full of jokes. it was more like visiting my brother and father. they are amazing and a great representation of the high quality service you can only find at the best hotels in dallas. i want to leave a sincere thank you to them.
1759,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"honestly, i am truly shocked at the reviews. because, while the hotel has good customer service (not the best) it has one of  “worst bathroom” in the world!! there is no “concept” of “hair removal” from the bathroom. i swear upon god i found the same curly strand of hair on the toilet seat tank surface for an entire week (even after their supposed cleaning)!! there was hair in the  bath tub swell. clearly, the worst cleaning mechanism so far that i have observed. the bathroom floor is old and cracked as well. the room carpet is not properly vacuum either. if you slightly move the decline or other smaller furniture you observe layers of dust on the carpet, that has taken a white hue. on top of all this my room had “zero overhead lighting”. out of the 4 lamps in the room the"
1760,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"we will definitely be back there. loved the hotel, eating at the bar/restaurant and the room was neat and clean and staff were very  friendly, and getting a text asking how was my stay the first night i definitely appreciated that."
1761,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,the valet service at the heart dallas was very helpful. a young lady by the name of marina got my car very fast and was even helping load our luggage in the car! it was super sweet and was helpful with the questions i did have!
1762,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"perhaps due to the time of year and the aftermath of could, this beautiful — and enormous — hotel was nearly empty when we visited. we saw literally only five other guests while we were there. it was one of the liveliest heart properties i’ve seen, with wasteful and modern furnishing, enormous vs, fantastic views of downtown and dealer place, and comfortable beds. everything was clean and quiet, and the staff was incredibly friendly, even bringing us bottle water to the room upon check-in. you have a choice of valet or self parking (a short walk), and there is room service available. we had an easy walk to the downtown / west end area, though most business and restaurant were closed. like the hotel, we saw very few people in dallas. the heart is a perfect choice because,"
1763,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"the stay was beautiful especially with my valet experience. i was resistant because at other hotels my experience wasn’t that great. my valet man, solomon, was just so friendly and treated me with great respect. overall, amazing experience!"
1764,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,very sad the bible not in room.   overall a nice stay. very clean. shouldn’t have to pay extra for parking and shouldn’t have to walk down street to park since there is a garage right there. forcing a person to valet which is quite expensive.
1765,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,this hotel was the best. we flew in from florida to dallas to celebrate my friend’s birthday. the location was superb and the city views were awesome. very clean and the front desk was so friendly.  would definitely stay here again.
1766,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"we haven’t been there for a few years and finally went back, to enjoy the hotel, the go deck view at the reunion tower and the restaurant there. we enjoyed also to see the art and shopping center close to there god the st time. we loved the stay there."
1767,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"my partner and i came to visit, and what a delight this trip was! our favorite part was breakfast ..custom omelettes, full buffets, and so much more. there wasn’t a single beat missed. we had a brief interaction with a team member, bolivia. i must say she was incredibly charming. it just so happened she was from new york as well. our experience here felt very personalized. we intended to return for the state fair this year, as per her suggestion! hospitality is on point here."
1768,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,picked the heart because it was relatively close to a concert downtown.  was an easy walk to lots of downtown attractions.  food at the bar and italian restaurant were both really good.  service was consistently friendly.  room was nice—much more comfortable chair and couch for relaxing than most hotels.  overall great stay!
1769,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"customer service is outstanding from the front desk to the valet. even when there was a small issue with our room, the front desk handled it. the room itself had an excellent view. shout out to will in the valet for quick service."
1770,hiltonuniversalcity,victor made one of the best dirty dirty margins i’ve ever had!!! highly recommend the bar area! our friend had a purple rain minora and really enjoyed it. the regular minora is good too. love victor!!!
1771,hiltonuniversalcity,"the service at the hilton and five on the hill restaurant was excellent. victor the bartender was also our server. he was phenomena and very professional and kind. alan the  manager of five  on the hill was awesome. he was professional, kind , made us feel at home and watered to our needs. he was phenomena. the hilton manager made sure we were also taking care of and watered to us also. he was phenomena. my experience staring he new year  was the best with these outstanding gentleman and establishment."
1772,hiltonuniversalcity,"daniel, maman, and jesus were so amazing! the customer service was great. the food was amazing and so quick to bring out! the drinks were even better!  great prices, great meals. we really loved the service we received here."
1773,hiltonuniversalcity,victor at the bar is phenomena. he serves a fantasist whiskey sour!! the presentation is amazing and the drink is delicious. it’s served with a gorgeous smoke that really adds a depth of flavor. highly recommend
1774,hiltonuniversalcity,"incredible customer service. the front desk made sure that the birthday weekend was acknowledged, and made very special for me and my family. thank you to romance and noah and baby for everything! ❤️❤️❤️❤️  room upgrade to excellent view and food was delicious!"
1775,hiltonuniversalcity,we enjoyed five on here with five amazing women. leo our waiter was friendly and easily available. francisco cruise made sure that our meals were on time and all of our needs were met. let the absence. love you. food was great.
1776,hiltonuniversalcity,seriously!!! ah-amazing!!!  came in for a nightcap....the blood orange whiskey martin...a must!!! and the bartender...victor!!! he's incredible! super nice and makes a fantastic martin! and he's friendly! just go and order!
1777,hiltonuniversalcity,"i had amazing afternoon hanging at the pool and in the canada.  the service from nicholas & maine was amazing.  they were both very friendly & attentive, making the afternoon even more enjoyable.  i look forward to coming back and hope to see them there!"
1778,hiltonuniversalcity,"we stopped in the lounge for a quick cocktail before heading to universal studies and ended up having 3. :-)  the drinks were very delicious and the service was outstanding.  we highly recommend stopping in to say hello to max the bartender and the bar back victor,  not only were the drinks amazing but the service was top notch   i recommend the spoke margaret, spice motto and mange hours shots"
1779,hiltonuniversalcity,loved my drinks from victor & era! they made us the best drinks :) appreciate their great service. :) they made their own creation for us. :)  definitely will be back in the future with more friends!!
1780,londonhouse,"george from guest services was outstanding! i was in town for a conference and had a car full of boxes. he immediately helped me unload and load my vehicle. he held items in storage for me at one point. and even brought boxes to my room. i was stressed and overwhelmed when i first arrived but he took care of everything. i don’t know what i would have done without him.  the room was spacious, comfortable, updated and clean. the view was of the chicago river.  the lobby bar has great food and drinks. the rooftop also has great food and drinks with an amazing view. the corner baker is on the main floor and a good breakfast choice. i also enjoyed the skeleton bike in the grm.  london house will forever be my first choice when traveling to chicago."
1781,londonhouse,"the london house staff is absolutely the most friendliest i have encountered! particularly a gentleman named shame - he was able to get me into a room quickly so i could get to my meeting meeting. well done, london house, chicago i will be back again.!!"
1782,londonhouse,"returning diamond member - the only hotel to stay at in chicago! consistently excellent - from the gorgeous rooms, spectacular views, food, service and most of all the amazing staff! big shout out to nail, kidney and marcus t who went above and beyond to assist us with this stay. politeness from all staff, attention to detail, cleanliness, and the extremely prompt fixing of some small maintenance items make this hotel stand out. check out the rooftop views in the nicer weather too!"
1783,londonhouse,"great hotel and very helpful staff! marcus a. was an excellent and thoughtful converge who checked me in. i very much enjoyed my stay, and i would definitely recommend others to stay here. next time in chicago, i will return!"
1784,londonhouse,"marcus a. checked me in and was very pleasant and professional.  his customer service was outstanding!  this was my first time visiting chicago and marcus a. suggested places to see, dine at as well as where my all time favorite…directed me where i can do endless shopping!!!  the hotel is literally near everything!!!  the room was clean and comfortable.  i have a beautiful view of the lake as well!!  the weather is cold and conveniently the hotel has a bar and a restaurant inside it.  if i visit chicago again i will definitely stay here again!"
1785,londonhouse,"nicolette was very welcoming and helpful with local rec! stayed at london house in january 2024 for a business trip. room was great, grm was clean and well equipped but one of the treadmill kept dying on me. food at the rooftop was excellent."
1786,londonhouse,"i highly recommend this hotel for its great service, luxurious amenities, and a prime location that enhanced your overall stay. i had the pleasure to stay in a room with a fabulous view thanks to have at the front desk, who was super welcoming and went above and beyond to ensure i had a memorable experience. she definitely took care of me 😉"
1787,londonhouse,"my stay at the londonhouse was amazing, the view from the room was great, i didn try the breakfast because of my early morning meetings. the rooftop is superb, the only complain is the windows are not soundproof, you can listen to the traffic from the street in front of the hotel"
1788,londonhouse,this hotel beautiful with great location. i've never been treated so well as a hilton diamond member. received an amazing upgrade given an issue with my booked room. marcus and the team there are top notch! a stay i'll always remember. lobby and bar area really nice too.
1789,londonhouse,"this was a great experience from the moment i walked in the door. all of the staff i encountered throughout my stay were friendly and helpful. the building is gorgeous and the rooms were comfortable, clean, and beautifully done. it was the perfect place to get stuck in a snow storm and subvert temps. special shout-out to nicolette and core who were super helpful and patient on the phone and at check-in with my changing plans, they made it really easy to work out the details. and nail for his help extending my room when things changed again. i’d come back in a heartfelt."
1790,swissotel,"we enjoyed the views, staff and suite ! the suite is on the with floor overlooking the city and water. an amazing fitness center on the with floor you can lookout with a view that is breathtaking !!  staff was very attentive as well, we will be back!"
1791,swissotel,"our stay was great, we had an amazing views from our corner room which i always appreciate and enjoy. room was surprisingly large and every day we also received an excellent house keeping service - thank you sand naval, very nice and friendly staff :)"
1792,swissotel,"we had an amazing stay at swissôtel chicago! all of the employees went above and beyond to make sure our stay was welcoming and enjoyable! james helped us with our valet and did an extraordinary job and was extremely kind! 10/10, would absolutely recommend staying at swissôtel."
1793,swissotel,"the view of navy pier is amazing (when the person who lived in the building next door wasn’t running around her place naked every night for hours). the bed is comfortable but that’s where the good ends. the room was dusty (as in-i don’t think they ever dust), popcorn ceiling looked stained but i believe it is due to dirty events-it was right where the vent tilted towards and was the same size. our room was dated and the drinking glasses in the room were disgusting (looks as if they were wiped with a dry cloth and left smear instead of being cleaned with dish soap). our last night there we were not able to sleep as there was a very loud hum/motor sound all night!!"
1794,swissotel,"beautiful view of the city from our room on the with floor! we attended a wedding reception on the and floor, which was nothing short of spectacular! the only problem we had was getting to the hotel. the gas directed us to the hotel via lower walker drive, but there is no entrance on that level. once we found our way to the entrance on upper walker drive, a great experience had begun!"
1795,swissotel,"the hotel was nice and staff very helpful and friendly. the food at the restaurant was awesome and having a grocer store near by marian was the best to pick up snacks. the view was awesome looking at navy pier was fun, and the causing was 7 min away in a car."
1796,swissotel,"best location and service on downtown area chicago. samuel is the best at front desk.  close to everything, the best view of the city. delicious omelet @ palm restaurant.  the personnel on valet parking, very kind."
1797,swissotel,"daring security staff returned valuable and irreplaceable item left in safe within 36 hours to out of state address. security and failing staff responded immediately to my packed bound call. this is so rare in my experience in such a high volume, reasonably prices hotel. i’d return for that, alone."
1798,swissotel,mary made our experience amazing. she had everything checked in early and made it a breeze.  when i checked in at the normal time everything was already done. the hotel had amazing views and clean rooms.
1799,swissotel,tendre from housekeeping was so accommodation and friendly! thank you tendre! we also had a great view of eye fireworks from our window. great location and fine establishment right in the downtown area!
1800,hotelriuplaza,"location is fine and that's the only positive. negative: they nickel and time you for anything, no tea or coffee in rooms, you pay extra for view but the view is terrible. the free breakfast is a joke, we are crammed like marines, the tables are never sanitized, the employees just wipe them down with a dirty rag that sits in their pockets.  one of the supervisors i guess albert has no customer service whatsoever and he needs to go. i asked him something and he said without looking at me ""that's not possible"" and walked away. we are not guests in this hotel, we are just paying tourist and they don't care about us. the bed has no comforted, just a very cheap and thin economy class plane blanket. new york has so many better opinions, if you want a good experience look elsewhere."
1801,hotelriuplaza,"great location, close to restaurant, bars and times square. far breakfast with plenty of choice and always being replenished. one down side are the tables being very close together and felt like you were on top of the next table. hotel clean and staff all pleasant and welcoming. hotel is very loud overnight due to location there was lots of traffic noise. rooms a little on the small side but everything you need in a room. although no tea/coffee making facilities. beds made daily and cleaned."
1802,hotelriuplaza,"and stay at this hotel. we upgrade again to the with floor with access to the lounge which we feel is worth the extra. the view from our room was fantastic and we had a little balcony (not that we’d use it that high up). bed comfortable the lounge has water, coffee, tea, wine and dizzy can available 24/7 as well as crisis, nuts, sandwiched, fruit and ve pots. breakfast has a great choice, because of the time of year there was no quiet time to go it was constantly busy. elevator were also especially busy in a morning.  staff friendly and welcoming.  christmas decorations were lovely 🎄"
1803,hotelriuplaza,"we had done a fair bit of searching for a hotel close to times square and not too far from the fun/action.  some reviews commented about the elevators being slow and also the breakfast having long lines. we were, admittedly, early risers but never had to wait longer than a couple of minutes to be seated. the buffets breakfast has something for everyone and was superb, this alone will save a family of four in excess of $100 a day easily.  the rooms are what you expect for a hotel in manhattan, and anyone expecting a flowing suite is being realistic at the price point for the hotel. the beds were really comfortable and clean, everything we wanted, and needed, in a decent hotel.  we managed to get a late checkout, albeit only by an hour, on new years eve and the staff were always"
1804,hotelriuplaza,just got back from this hotel from a 4 night break for my with - now what a hotel rooms were super come and amazing views of the city - small fridge in room the only thing i missed was a kettle but no big deal breakfast started at am and a starbucks was across the road  literally right on footstep of times square and 5-10 min walk to rockefeller and radio city - 10 mind walk to th avenue and 15 mind to empire state building subways 2 mind to get to ground zero and statue of liberty   hotel staff very helpful   breakfast great loads to choose from although gets busy after am but don’t have to wait too long   this hotel is perfect location we stayed on with floor - lifts really quick so no waiting around  would recommend this hotel to anyone
1805,hotelriuplaza,"all the staff are amazing, really friendly. excellent location. breakfast is actually very good, although small room for the amount of people staying at hotel.  the negative are the size of the bedrooms my room at home is bigger. it's tiny. couldn't even open suitcase on the floor. bathroom is just glass surround. so your partner or who ever you travelling with can hear you going toilet etc.... the room was either boiling hot or freezing cold. didn't replace water in the room either.  deposit has also taken over 2 weeks to come back to us.  i've re booked new york for halloween but choosing to stay near central park instead this time.  for £1900 for 4 nights i expected a little more!"
1806,hotelriuplaza,"really good hotel. excellent service and breakfast. room was clean, quite small but comfortable and adequate for two people. a couple of issues experienced with the lifts which was quite annoying at busy times. you either can't get in the lifts, or it repeatedly visits numerous different floors, both up and down when you are trying to reach the floor you require. the resort fee seems to be standard in america, but to be honest, this baffled me. $133 for four nights, which i appreciate isn't an exceptional amount, but other than 2 bottles of water in the room, i'm not really sure what i paid this fee for. its more of a tax than a resort fee. that said, i had a pleasant enjoyable stay, and the excellent rating is well deserved. i wouldn't hesitate in recommending or visiting this"
1807,hotelriuplaza,"i’ve stayed in a number of rid hotels and i’ve always had a great time. from mexico to jamaica to dominican republic and even spain, i’ve always been really impressed with all they do and how they make me feel when i’m there. but i’m afraid i can’t really say the same about the rid place in times square new york. the hotel looks really nice and quiet opulence from the entrance into the hotel lobby area so i felt like it was going to be yet another far time but that’s where the similarities ended. the room was acceptable for an inner city stay in such a heavily populated city as new york. you get a lot less space in paris so i didn’t expect anything like the beautiful suites you have in the caribbean or tropical locations, but i was really disappointed with the bedding set up and"
1808,hotelriuplaza,great hotel. great location. we walked pretty much everywhere from this hotel. staff were amazing- could not do more to help. breakfast included which is great to start the morning without thinking where to eat. thank you for a great stay from the up!
1809,hotelriuplaza,"our room was well appointed and room we were also very happy with the cleanliness and spaciousness of the room.  breakfast was excellent.  staff were hardworking and very friendly and welcoming.  the hotel itself is located a close walk to everything from the main hut at times square, to central park, broadway, grand central station.  even close enough for reasonable walk to ground zero.  the hotel has an abundance of restaurant, cases, bars, miners all within easy walking distance.  my wife and i will be happy to stay again at rid place time square new york. thank you all staff.  rich & kolya, adelaide, st must."
1810,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"our family of three enjoyed a quick stay at this hotel. we love the giant heart atriums and our son especially enjoyed watching and riding the elevators. the view was lovely and the ease of getting to the reunion tower can't be beat. our room was spacious but just so-so--beds were nothing special, most pillows much too hard. bathroom had the only mirror and only one towel hook and the half-pocket doors were hard to keep closed and were noisy. no fan meant the windows steamed up when we showered--so much for the great view. if you want to eat breakfast at the hotel be sure to have it included in the price, otherwise it's very expensive for what it was--a basic buffets. foi the self-park is down the hill and across the street"
1811,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"i have always stayed at heart wherever i go, i love staying at regency, and the location is convenient. i got an upgrade to a suite without even asking. that's so kind of them to do that. my suite was nice and clean. order food for room service was such a pleasure, my food was delivered on time as they promised. overall, heart never fails me. my family always looks forward to our stay each vocation."
1812,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"in town for one night for a cheer competition at the convention center. arrived to the hotel around pm and the valet area was very busy, but i was helped very quickly.  the hotel is very large and is very loud based on the open concept.  the room was good size, but is starting to look a little dated.  we walked to the convention center for the competition and it was a very easy quick walk from the hotel.  check out was easy and quick and the valet had my car pulled up quickly.  i booked this hotel on points and was pleased with my stay."
1813,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,awful experience. people had reaches in their rooms. i saw one running across the floor near the elevators. the bathroom near the elevator is falling apart. they delivered the gift i ordered for my cousin to the wrong room. just don't go here.
1814,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"my stay at heart regency dallas was a mixed experience. one drawback was the absence of a microwave in the rooms, requiring us to bring our food down to the coffee shop for heating. this inconvenience was disappointing. additional, the beds seemed outdated and lacked the expected comfort. on the positive side, the hotel's location and service were commendable, but the lack of room amenities and the comfort level of the beds impacted our overall satisfaction."
1815,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"was a good stay, but it had some pain points. the lobby and common areas of the hotel are spacious & nice. if you do self-parking, you park in a lot that is down the street(almost a quarter mile walk), and then you walk back up to the hotel entrance. that isn't great, but the price of the self-parking is very reasonable by today's standards in comparison to other hotels. the grm was decent, but the pool wasn't that great. at least it does provide a small rooftop view. the room is what you normally get at a heart regency, good size, good for working. it has electric blinds that lower and raise at the push of a button. the bathroom was just okay, but gets the job done. there was also a chaise in the room that was good for sitting by the window. our room was on the side next to the"
1816,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,huge hotel with a very small pool and grm. rooms with city views are nice to look out of when night time. stayed on with floor and could hear the train horns and rakes from 6 am to 11 pm. multiple train tracks run in front of hotel and multiple highways on other side of hotel.
1817,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"wasn’t my choice of hotels to stay at.  just a big genetic convention-type hotel that can swallow up a bunch of guests.  not a lot of charm.  rooms are what you expect for a hotel of this sort ak, “business functional genetic.”  entire hotel, as other reviews have mentioned, is slightly dated.  smallish bathroom.  good toiletries though.  “pharmacopia” brand.  “cruelty-free and began.”  yeah yeah little bottles and individual little cakes of soap.  i’m sure detractors will complain about the impact on the environment.  but you know what?  if i’m paying a few hundred dollars/night,  i really don’t want to feel like i’m showering in a grm with those wall mounted body wash and shampoo dissenters.  those things are gross.  room does have a mind-fridge which was a plus.  no"
1818,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"the people at the bar do not like their job and treat people rudely with disrespect when i say people it’s really just two women hanging up on the customer was total disrespect very rude in front of my son and never again well i come back to that establishment based on how i was treated everything else could’ve been overlooked but i was treated rudely with aggression and very disrespected. not once did i hire my voice or anything to any of these ladies, and it will be the last time that i will be going to that hotel, based on how i was treated very poorly"
1819,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,the worst hotel i have stayed tears due to the noise level on the and floor. not only can you hear the trains and emergency vehicles but everyone in the always.the room is great and the views but my family had a horrible night sleeping so we will be glad to leave after 1 night to stay in frisco for the rest of our thanksgiving vacation to be near family.
1820,homewoodsuites,"amen is the best! what a daring and compassionate man! he will try ( and accomplish) anything you need for your stay. i am going to miss this wonderful man as i move on to the project. he knows, works and lives customer service! every hotel needs an amen!"
1821,homewoodsuites,malo stay is amazing as always!  staff is accommodation and responds to requests quickly!  rooms are clean and breakfast and evening receptions are awesome.  i love the staff who work extremely hard to make my stay exceptional!
1822,homewoodsuites,"the hotel staff in the breakfast area is very very very amazing! i would especially like to shout out ana, jefferson, louis (i believe he was the horseman) and marina (i really liked her glasses). box"
1823,homewoodsuites,"this hotel is known for its convenience but what it should be known is for their service. the staff is great, in particular mania. she was above and beyond helpful and always  pleasant and nice. the hotel is within walking distance of the cavity and times square, which is a plus. i can’t wait to stay here again."
1824,homewoodsuites,"stayed here the other week for a week-long stay and it was a decent experience. booked direct and my studio was available slightly before the posted check-in time.  arrived earlier in the afternoon, did a pre-check-in, and dropped off my luggage with the front desk. there was a security in the lobby... elevators require a keyboard to go up to the suites.  during the check-in process, there was no acknowledgment of status nor my 2 bottles of water...   the suite itself was spacious by ny standards at 300+ sq feet. the bathroom was functional, although it could have used some deep cleaning at the bottom of the shower stall along with the baseboards... water pressure was good. a handed shower would have been good too.  the mattress was on the softer side and was the lower end"
1825,homewoodsuites,"the hotel is great not only for its location but for service, staff, food, and many option! the lookout facility is perfect for grm lovers and rooms have a fridge, microwave, and coffee maker. the most lovely thing i liked was the rooftop that gave me immense pleasure and this place is best for meeting new people."
1826,homewoodsuites,"the front desk representative was so awesome when check in last night. i told the gentlemen that i've been having trouble with the digital key when i stay hilton hotel and just give me the regular key, the front desk agent said give him 5 minutes and he's going to fix it for for.i said ok and sure enough  he told its fixed try it out i used the digital key in the elevator one shot i used it on my room door one shot bless that young man for taken his time for fixing my problem then i got even more excited about my room it was gorgeous. the moral of the story is hospitality at its finest / what to expect when you arrive at a hotel."
1827,homewoodsuites,i would like to take time to highlight all of the staff at homeward suites in milton for the work that they do everyday.     this week i'm sending buds to oliver for his consistent pattern in showing not only a professional midst but a true authentic leadership style.  his life purpose of showing up to work with a smile and interesting with guest definitely connect with the hotels mission and values.  thanks oliver for showing me your trueself.
1828,homewoodsuites,"stayed here for 10 nights - hotel room was the quietest hotel room i’ve ever stayed in. space and bed was comfortable and loved having the kitchen. hotel is walking distance to everything in milton and nearby subways so ny is within reach. everyone was extremely friendly and helpful at the hotel, especially elizabeth and rochelle. breakfast was always good and so nice to have included daily. will continue to recommend this hotel to everyone i know and will be back!"
1829,homewoodsuites,"during my stay from 1/22-1/26, felix in house keeping was very pleasant and friendly. i asked for splendid delivered to my room (1602), he brought it quickly. it's anaemic times and there is staff shortage. number of guests has likely not reduced. so there is extra pressure on staff. he not only delivered on time, he had a big smile on his face when he showed up. i greatly appreciate his service with a smile and promptness."
1830,hollywoodhotel,"claude and pillar were the best! i came for the rest, and stayed for the service! oil also was great! good price and accommodation. will stay again!   the hotel is city centered and nearby all of the great attractions. 5 min away from everything. and i repeat, the service was the best! claude is super helpful in guiding us and giving city advice. pillar is very charismatic and recommends the best breakfast places."
1831,hollywoodhotel,"daniel is the best front desk hotel guy in all of hollywood. he is friendly, handsome charming and will bend over backwards to make sure his guests are comfortable.   if you’re in hollywood, there’s no better place to stay than the hollywood hotel. ask for daniel and tell him mike sent you good luck."
1832,hollywoodhotel,oil was really good to us guests. he took care. of us and made sure we had a great experience. we liked the pool and everything else about the hotel we booked. oil should get more credit for the work he does.
1833,hollywoodhotel,"nice hotel with spacious rooms! hotel has a sea and pool with neat views. hotel staff is excellent, especially oil at the front desk! oil was very friendly and helpful! will stay here again just for the great service!!"
1834,hollywoodhotel,"this hotel is great bang for you bucks. it is generally located and offers everything you could want in a good hotel. daniel at the front desk was super helpful, and got me situated into a comfortable room upon arriving early.  highly recommend if you're looking for something nice and easy on the pocketbook!"
1835,hollywoodhotel,it’s a great budget hotel. the pictures are quite deceiving as it is not as modern as it looks. we had a spacious room and the maids did a great job at keeping it clean and tidy pill on reception was great too!   i think if you’re on a budget in the city you aren’t going to get better than this!!! down town is only 12 dollars in an user so i would say location is fine. only issue with the location is that there isn’t really many shops near by. we ended up getting an user to target which was 7 dollars. there is a fridge which is great and a safe which was really secure. you couldn’t ask for much more than being a bit more modern   would i stay again? no i think i would splash the budget a bit more and stay somewhere nicer. but if it’s your first time and your budget conscious
1836,hollywoodhotel,"the hotel was clean, bus service in front of hotel, retro one block away.  pool is very nice except they have face grass and tile which is very hot, you can not walk on it barefoot. we stayed three nights, first night the air conditioning was on, when coming back from a hot buggy day, out room air conditioned was not on, we asked for them to look at, they also asked us if we wanted a fan? after a couple hours they moved us to another room.  same thing happened the next night.  when we told them they asked was the lower on in the room, we said yes but it was not blowing cold air.  not too concerned.  not sure if they have problems with there air conditioned or they are just too cheap and turn it on.  you pay all this money to stay at a hotel."
1837,hollywoodhotel,"all the staff always responded kindly during our stay at the hotel, especially oil is the best! the bathroom door is not working well and that is the only problem. but the pool is the best place to have time."
1838,hollywoodhotel,"great customer service. the pool area is very nice and clean, the lounging chairs were very comfortable. oil and staff were very friendly and accommodation to our needs. i would highly recommend staying here"
1839,hollywoodhotel,"we were exhausted from working and traveling and oil made our experience so easy and pleasant. we were stressed about finding parking in a new city so it was so awesome to have a gazed in parking lot. really come beds, cut pool and great service!!"
1840,londonhouse,wonderful hotel! well located with beautiful views of the river. the room was spacious and the bed was super come. water pressure in the shower could be better. many thanks to have who was friendly and extremely helpful! will definitely come back.
1841,londonhouse,"great location. walking distance to the riverbank and river bruises, and so many other attractions i wanted to visit.   my room was clean, with a come bed. lovely shower. my only suggestion is that i would have appreciated drinks available in the room other than coffee.   the staff that i dealt with were all really helpful."
1842,londonhouse,"the london house truly stands out among the hotels i've stayed in. the rooms are fantastic, offering a comfortable and luxurious stay. however, it's important to note that the price point is quite high, and the hotel tends to charge extra for room upgrade, especially if you desire a room with a view. while the additional costs can add up, the quality of service and the overall experience justify the expense for those who prioritize luxury. if budget allows, the upgrade to a room with a view is worth considering, as it adds an extra touch to the stay. money certainly talks in each area, but the quality of accommodations here makes it a standout choice despite the premium pricking."
1843,londonhouse,"everything about this place was so nice.  the staff, the scenery, when i got there my room was upgrade due to my stay and from them on everything just continue to be great. it was the weekend of mexican independence day so downtown was festive and i loved everything about the stay. the rooftop was amazing, the rooftop bar was great and there’s just nothing i could ask for that i didn’t have. i walked a lot around the city because it’s so convenient. my only regret is that i didn’t get to try the restaurant that everyone raved about but i will next time. i planned to before my flight but didn’t realize they weren’t open that early. can’t wait to return and thanks again."
1844,londonhouse,"one of the best states i've ever had! immediately upon checking in, i was given a complimentary upgrade and ensued that my stay was pleasant. ken at the front desk was so daring and kind! the room is glorious and the sea is wonderful! i will be coming back for sure! anyone who is staying in chicago should definitely stay here!"
1845,londonhouse,great staff at this hotel!  ken the supervisor at the front desk is awesome and maurice at the rooftop bar is a fantastic bartender along with his team!  try the ll old fashioned!  it's delicious!  this is the best hotel in chicago!
1846,londonhouse,"house in an architectural  blockbuster landmarks building, at the intervention of the magnificent mile and the chicago river, is the londonhouse chicago....a hotel that is all about views. my vista room fearing floor-to-ceiling windows afforded me eye-popping views of the cityscape and the spacious, marbleized bath was outfitted with a glass walled walk-in shower. londonhouse features several dining and drinking option. land & lake, at street level, is ideal for breakfast and casual dining while the lobby bar is a perfect communal spot for drinks and  like food fare. ocean prime is the fine dining on-site option. i treated myself to french onion soup, clean sea bass with roasted brussels sprout here.............great food. the hotel is packed with other amenities in the"
1847,londonhouse,nicolette was so helpful at the front desk. her recommendations were top notch and she really brings such a welcoming energy to the hotel. the rooftop had great views. i’m so glad i stopped by at londonhouse. :)
1848,londonhouse,"loved my stay  guest services team was awesome. buds to core, kidney and nail who made my stay so pleasant.  lobby bar could be a bit better - service was friendly but non efficient and slow.   views are stunning! i will definitely be coming back!!"
1849,londonhouse,"when i first decided to stay at this hotel for my last three nights in chicago, i had high expectations, especially about the view. thanks to core, the hotel staff who helped me check in, i had a great time both day and night with a view that was even better than i expected. i woke up with sunshine, enjoyed a cup of coffee by the window overlooking the river, and fell asleep after admiring the night view of the  buildings ahead of the window.  i would like to say thank you so much to core for his sincere help, even though i  gathered him with credit cards and other things :) . also i highly recommend this hotel when staying in chicago. staying in this hotel itself was a good experience during this trip. besides the view, the hotel provided perfect room conditions and amenities"

1857,fairmontdallas,i was staying at the fairmont for the na cheer competition.  i was by myself with my two daughters.  we were so happy that our room was ready and waiting early when we arrived.  after getting ready for competition we headed downtown to find parking for the event.  well there was not a spot to be found.  we came back to the hotel in a panic that we would miss our event and elpedio in valet jumped into action and delivered us to our event.  fast forward to the evening and my phone charge wasn’t working.  i asked valet to check my car for an extra charge.  while waiting elpedio was still working.  i thanked him for helping me earlier and made conversation.  when valet returned my car we could not find another charge.  without hesitation elpedio offered me his charge and
1858,fairmontdallas,"valet team was incredible! these guns were top notch. upon arrival they were i incredibly attentive, efficient and friendly. they remembered us every time we came and went from the hotel. protect these guns at all costs, it’s hard to find workers like them!"
1859,fairmontdallas,"good location, very friendly and helpful staff. the converge was a fearless experience especially help from philip, buds !! would recommend hotel to others visiting the downtown area who want quick access to downtown and the highway.  cleanliness was up to standards. my only negative would be slightly outdated bathroom. but this is being pick !"
1860,hoteledison,"this hotel is in the perfect location for theater going.  staff was so friendly and helpful.  i went for my with birthday and found a bottle of wine, schmackery colonies, and chocolate in my room.  the rum house happy hour was great and the grab and go breakfast or $5.00 voucher for either of the two restaurant were a great bonus.  i would highly recommend!"

1863,hoteledison,"stayed with a friend here. hotel has a very classic old school ny vice, but room had a modern feel. clean and comfortable. staff were friendly. i like the restaurant here. you can catch some jazz or broadway singers in the hotel restaurant. fun times!"
1864,hoteledison,"beautiful historic hotel right in the middle of times square--close to everything: restaurant, theaters, and famous sites. the madison happy hour is top notch bringing in broadway talent and so much fun! freedman's restaurant in the lobby has singing waters and the rum house bar (also in the lobby) is ""old school"" new york.  i highly recommend a stay at the madison!"
1865,hoteledison,"the hotel location is great and the room had a comfortable view and was bigger than some rooms in ny.  what let this hotel down for me was the staff - they all seemed very helpful and inconvenience by guests. particularly the door staff are who have upset me as they didn't so much as open the door once throughout the whole 3 night stay - i don't mind this, i don't need someone to open a door for me, however when i left the hotel i ordered a cab using curb to go to the airport, and this seemed to annoy the door staff, who then also made a remark about me to the cab driver and made the journey feel very awkward... was i wrong to use curb?! if the door staff have not interested with me once throughout the whole stay, why would i bother them for a taxi.  it's a shame that this"
1866,hoteledison,this is a wonderful hotel!  very clean and the beds are comfortable. they even leave little snacks for you in your room when you first arrive. i was even greeted at my check out by rome gomez who was very charming and helpful. i will definitely be back.
1867,hoteledison,"great location. housekeeping, cleanliness, bed and pillows a+!  don’t miss a cocktail at rum house, singing waters at friedland. best meal of 4 days at bond 45. felt safe. too warm in room and loud banging from pipes in walls kept me sleep deprived though. sink has no layout space for toiletries. free bottle water. coffee maker upon request.  front desk refused request for glass wine glasses in room.   would stay there again if i could be assured of no nightly pipe banging sounds from heating system."
1868,hoteledison,"fantastic location but spoils by the absolute diabolical attitude of the staff on the front desk. rude and abrasion on check in to guests. no hello, welcome to hotel madison and proceed to check customers in with a friendly demeanour. they demanded ‘passport’ and made us feel like we had walked in off the street to inconvenience them.   the hidden charges on resort fees are basically just a way to rob guests of more money. apparently it’s for amenities and peaks but there aren’t even tea or coffee facilities in the rooms. the bathroom is in the wardrobe and the staff can’t even crack a smile so not sure what the fees are that we now have pay on checkout.   bed and breakfast option is also another way to stealth grab money from guests. they advertise its bed and breakfast and"
1869,hoteledison,"i cannot say enough good things about the hotel madison. from the front of the house to the back of the house, everyone is friendly, courteous, and professional. this was our th year that our group of food and theatre lovers stayed at this historic property. many members of our group often return at different times during the year and this is where they stay!!! thank you, hotel madison for your welcome and generous hospitality."
1870,hoteledison,"the worst room i’ve ever stayed at - dark (no ceiling lights), just 1 bedside lamp between two double beds. tired and old door, small room size, tiny basic bathroom with mold, cracked door and many areas in the room that needed to be looked at. 2 bottles of water and 1 x small bottle of shower get for 4 people for the whole stay. no tea/coffee/kettle or fridge in the room. there’s a safe but it’s payable, have to wipe your credit card to activate it.  security by the lift would ask to see your room key every time you use the lift.  i found the lady at the breakfast restaurant rude. no smoking family outdoor nearby the hotel.   woke up at 04:00 the first morning from a loud bending noise from the huge flag that was position outside the window. i wish i could unload a video"
1871,hoteledison,"grand entrance, then it goes downhill from there. check in was ok albeit an unfriendly first impression.  room for 4 people should have had 2 x queen beds, they were double beds… 2 bottles of water in room for 4 people, this never changed in a 5 day stay no tea/coffee making facility, i inquired at reception for this, this was then brought to the room, well almost thrown at us, although no cups. we asked the housekeeping again 2 days later and she provided what we needed (happily)  the carpet is fatty and torn, several filthy areas in the room including a previous residents sock! bathroom events covered in dust and debris. little bit grim to be honest.  felt like german rather than a customer. speak to the reception at your peril!  an average offering and would not recommend for"
1872,hoteledison,excellent location in theatre district and times square.  good service and clean room.  lot of history in this hotel.  only summer was that the with street access was blocked; thought likely for security.  everything of interest was within walking distance.
1873,hoteledison,the hotel madison is a wonderful place to stay in new york city to take in broadway shows.  it is s short distance from the discount ticket booth on times square and sits squarely in the heart of the theater district and on subways lines that connect to laguardia.  the staff is friendly and helpful (like melissa at the front desk) and the rooms comfortable and well appointed.  the grab and go breakfast saves time and gets one started promptly.  i really like the art deck look and all the paintings in the lobby.  the 6 elevators are fast and efficient.  i was pleased to learn of the history of the hotel from general manager guiding de los santo who introduced me to the hotel's owner who was visiting.  i return to the hotel madison every year because it makes my stay so enjoyable.
1874,hoteledison,"after booking through a third party, we arrived for our stay with the wrong name on our reservation. daniel went above and beyond to help us fix it and upgrade our room at no cost. this employee took a super distressful time and slipped it to a positive! thanks daniel!"
1875,hoteledison,scar they take £180 per room and say there is an extra £29.00 for security and you'll get it bag one massive scar it's got be happening to everyone and they just for you off and get away with it i know you pay tax on room it dose say that but take extra money and not give it back is just wrong as we're from england you would think they wouldn't want people to not want to go to new york a second time but we loved it but hotel madison is a scar . hotel.  !!!!
1876,hoteledison,"so utterly disappointed. i saved for the whole year, spent a fortune to give my children the trip of a lifetime and we were put into a room facing a brick wall. it also had a radiated that must have been faulty as was very noisy we asked to change rooms and to be fair the staff changed, but the rooms were just as bad except for noisy radiated. my beautiful view waking up in new york is not happening, it’s like a prison cell. i’d hoped to give the children a now experience and now i feel i have to snap out of this sheer disappointment to make the best of a bad situation as we’re here now :( no coffee machine either and lukewarm shower water. i’m in tears here as almost £3000 down and i’d rather be at home :( . this is the first time i’ve ever complained about a hotel and i’m not"

1878,hoteledison,"christian at the reception of hotel madison ny provided us with exceptional service during our stay. from the moment we arrived, her warm welcome and professionalism made us feel valued as guests. she efficiently handled our check-in process, ensuring that all our references were met. throughout our stay, christian was always available to assist with any inquiries or requests, going above and beyond to make our experience memorable. her friendly demeanour and attention to detail truly exemplary the high standards of hospitality at hotel madison. we highly commend christian for her outstanding service and contribution to making our stay enjoyable. she is a true asset to the hotel's team."""
1879,hoteledison,"beautiful hotel.    very helpful staff.    every where thoroughly clean.    voucher for breakfast were very welcome.     5 mind (if that) to times sq.     central to all the tourist bits, we used hop on hop off bus.   surrounded by the broadway theaters.   the tickets for shows can be brought cheaper than through the hotel, so that just one small negative to be aware of."
1880,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"arrived at pm and was told the restaurant and bar were closed for renovation, the lobby looked desperately in need of a renovation… and the room i was given hadn’t been upgrade in decades!  when i complained i was given the key to another room that was equally as depressing!   finally called apex and was able to get a room at the simpson…. but the magnolia refused to refund the full amount i had paid.  excusable!!  do not go to this hotel unless they have a total renovation …. and change their attitude and treatment of guests!  the desk staff were helpful and nearing about their guests.  two other people were at the front desk while i was waiting for the room change, asking for towels — there were none in their rooms.  no one looked happy!"
1881,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"this was not a pleasant stay. first off i hate to leave bad reviews because most will report negative experiences but less likely the positive, and i hate to do so also. this just need to be made aware of though. my issue was initially when entering the establishment it had an old breaking odor not pleasant fresh air. the staff informed me at check-in the room the i reserved was not avail due to a problem they’ve been having with homeless entering & them having to remove them (not what u expect from front desk staff for a $558/2 day stay anywhere).. i was disappointed more entering the room & the smell from the lobby was worse. i was immediately not feeling well (caseous). the room was dirty, with multiple issues. they did not live up to moving me as they stated (until the next"
1882,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"the hotel staff was nice and upgrade me to a suite for free, room 1826. the suite was a fabulous size and had a kitchen and living room area. however, that did not make up for the fact that the rooms are old and in need of a serious removed. paint was peeling. there were stains on the walls and on the cloth blinds. the furniture was whipped. the carpet looks like it hasn’t been cleaned in years. when i turned on the water in the bathtubs, hair came out of the drain. the bathroom towel was torn. i got a really good last minute deal through god, but it still didn’t make up for the condition of this hotel. additional, the valet cost almost $45 per night and took at least 20 minutes to bring my car. overall, less than cellar experience."
1883,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,the room was not what i expected lots of homeless people in the lobby and a less than friendly guest staff to boot. i really would not recommend this place to anyone who wants the best of dallas. that
1884,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"had to move rooms at 130am because the smoke alarm started chirping and they couldn't get a ladder to change the battery. lobby was out of coffee by am when i left. i asked if they would at least come a snack for the trouble, they refused. i do not recommend."
1885,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"probably the worst hotel i've ever stayed at. the rooms were dark and dated (thank god for my ring light). when i inquired about an upgrade being that it was one of the free peaks for being an expedite gold member, they told me all the rooms looked the same.   i lost my phone in my user, i asked was there a computer i could use to log into my user account to contact the driver. they said no and told me to try the hotel next door. how insane does that look me going next door to use their computer when i'm staying elsewhere. no empty at all from the manager, just a very ""oh well"" attitude.   there was 1 wash rag in the room, no house keeping for the 3 days i was there. i inquired about towels at 8:40, they told me they'd send it up when house keeping arrives at 10. 10!!!! as if"
1886,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"my stay started out great. the front desk agent was super kind, engaging and helpful. she put me towards the top floor as i mentioned i was just staying one night to sleep and enjoy silence (4 kiss/toller twins and a wife who’s an overnight nurse). in the morning i was unable to shower and at check out found out the pipes froze. they said they were moving people but i didn’t get notified. i asked for small come and the manager just said that because it was out of their hands there was nothing they could do. just weak customer service."
1887,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"what a sad hotel with no upgrade in furnishing or door or even quality carting in the room. yes, it has great views and a great location. the lobby has been photoshopped on sites — it’s quite underwhelming."
1888,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,"absolutely fantastic!! my room was huge with breathtaking views of the city…and the giant eyeball! everything was very clean, i loved the huge bathtubs and my bed was super copy. i woke up to the sunrise and a beautiful skyscraper view. rosa was the front desk agent and was extremely friendly, accommodation and helpful. she provided the best customer service. i’m so happy i picked this place and can’t wait to come back! even the valets were all very helpful, kind and smiling. i love it here and don’t want to leave ll. i saw bad reviews and honestly don’t know what’s wrong with them and why they’re being parents. this place is a score of a place for the price  with a had location too.   sincerely,   happy oregon tourist"
1889,magnoliahoteldallasdowntown,great location for solo traveler-across the street from the exchange which is like a small square where people gather they have 16 different restaurant right there-short walk to sites. $10 user to state fair. hotel room was as expected also very quiet
1890,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"the room's view and the proximity to the crown block restaurant and reunion tower were the best things about the room.  the room we paid to be ""upgrade"" to due to the view, was nice enough, but very worn.  the brown sofa was very aged and worn, the sheets actually had a tear in them, and the pillows were lump, as was the bed.  that being said…the night's sleep was not restful and we were up and down several times trying to get comfortable.  there were only 3 pillows for the king size bed, which i thought was odd, however after discovering there were down pillows, i did request foam replacement from the front desk and they politely obliged removing the feather pillows and i believe the due from the room, as they left us with 2 blankets and just a top sheet on the bed.  so,"
1891,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"we do not visit heart hotels often, always outing for a hotel that have  an executive lounge.  i wish heart would go that route. i’m impressed with heart’s customer service.  i always get an upgrade. haven’t gotten an upgrade in 13 years with merritt even as a lifetime titanic member.  this hotel is in bad need of an upgrade.  the carpet and furniture are badly stained and worn; not only in my room but also the common areas.  other than that, i like this hotel. the hotel staff  is professional and are very kind and they really stand above hilton and merritt staff.  heart need to make some dramatic upgrade, other than that, it’s a nice hotel."
1892,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,we arrived after a very delayed flight. i requested a quiet room as i was very jet lagged and we were given a lovely peaceful room. the hotel was very busy but every attention to detail was given. the room was spotless and supplied with a selection of toiletries. i would thoroughly recommend staying here when visiting dallas.
1894,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"stayed here for true and thought it was a lovely hotel. room was immaculate clean and had a great view of the city. front desk staff, cleaning people and workers at the 24/7 coffee shop were all very kind. the hotel design is cool with impressive elevator views and the reunion tower views are absolutely crazy. the only thing that scared me were the crazy high views over a balcony area on our floor that had zero guardrails or protection and all i could imagine was final destination 6. one drunken slip and it would be death. kind of scar. on a somewhat more serious note, our friend who was also staying  at the hotel for the event used the valet parking service during his stay and he received his car on the final day of his stay with a completely flat tire. it was not flat when"

1896,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"my wife and i stayed here for a convention she had to attend. i believe there was a slight discount on the rooms at $199, but there was a $3.98 reimbursement fee, 7% city tax, 6% state tax, parking fee and then parking tax. so even with the slight discount, it was $242/night. this was using the self park for $12/day. valet parking is $36/day!!! we marked in the lot north of the hotel, which is a little walk from the hotel in dallas heat. i think the other self park lot is even farther away, if the north lot is full. breakfast buffets was $21 at the centennial. at first the witness told us they only served from buffets, but then she did bring us a menu and said she would let us order from the menu that time. there were stains on the seaboard. once or twice i called the front desk"

1924,hotelriuplaza,"hotel is in a prime location right in the middle of all the tourist hot spots, literally a 2 min walk to times square and many theaters on broadway. you can't really go wrong with booking the hotel if you're looking for a prime location. the rooms weren't anything amazing but had everything you needed - although the shower was perfect! the air con/heating system seemed a bit temperamental, one minute you're hot then the next you're cold so that was slightly annoying but otherwise, nothing major in the grand scheme of things. plenty of subways stations nearby, too."

1934,swissotel,"spent 5 nights here during thanksgiving week. we knew the location was great but we were pleasantly surprised about everything else about the hotel. starting from the friendliness at the desk with daisy all the way to the breakfast staff with alexandria, adrian and marie. the staff is not only attentive to every detail, but they are also very cordial. we ate breakfast at the hotel everyday and it was absolutely amazing. best breakfast sandwich you can have and the croissants are some of the best we have had in the us.  will definitely be back !"

1940,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"make sure you use the hotel scuttle, quick and easy. check-in was fast and pleasant. pretty isolated  from anything-valuable to food/shopping but about 15mins plus walk, very quiet surrounding area mostly commercial.  room was spacious and clean but very noisy from the planes. very limited food option between 2-pm- appalled at three day old sandwiched/ salad for sale with only fresh option re-heated penza at $9 a slice. wouldn’t recommend this hotel especially for families who would expect to be able to purchase food prepared fresh each day at daytime without having to leave the hotel."
1941,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"this hotel is not even close to being worth the money that they charge for it. we spent $350 per night middle of the week for the king suite with the wraparound windows. unfortunately, this room type does not have a city view. you get a view of the traffic. besides that the room is decorated in boring an and gray. there is no color at all. the room also needs dating furniture was whipped, finished were stained and paint needed touching up. the mattress cover was too small for the mattress and all night. i was laying on the piece of stretched elastic over the corner that i could feel through the thin sheets. very uncomfortable. also, the pillows were really hard. it was a pretty big disappointment for the amount of money. also, the breakfast buffets is $27 per person. we often"

1943,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"beautiful hotel, staff is friendly and accommodation, but i was really disappointed. self parking is at the bottom of a hill and there is a second lot but no one could clearly explain where it is located.   room we paid for a city view which was gorgeous but what they don't tell you is that the hotel is next to the train tracks and highway. so the city view is on the side of the tracks and you hear it all night long. so the rooms are paper thin. our first night someone decided to blast a song at am and it was loud. we thought it was a do at a party.  rooms were clean, the water from the shower felt great.   amenities  pool tables dont exist, the roof top pool is more like a giddy pool. the grm was nice. great equipment and space.   room services you must order by or and cannot"
1944,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,i loved this hotel. the rooms were very clean. and the breakfast bar was absolutely delicious. the staff was extremely kind. there are 3 restaurant in this hotel all of which i would highly recommend. we were just going to pass through dallas but this hotel got us to stay another night.
1945,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,stayed here for sisters wedding. nancy came to pick up my kiss and car was marked for less than 30 minutes. they didn’t even move it from the front driveway. was still charged close to 30 dollars for that.
1946,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"room wasn't clean, kiss feet were black from walking on the carpet. bathroom was cramped and run down. sink was cracked. everything had an extra ""tax"" on it making it more expensive. parking is around the corner and down the hill. not well lit or secure. signs everywhere saying hide your stuff.  what they charge for parking is also very high for not being attached to the hotel.  overall very disappointing."
1947,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"the parking staff here are amazing. they go out of their way to greet each guest with kindness, excellence, and execution. each guest is treated with importance and each car is treated with the utmost care. such an amazing team!!"
1948,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"this was the best suite in a hotel i have ever stayed in. the room size was very large with an accompanying living area outside of the bedroom that was beautifully appointed and comfortable when we entertained 12 people. room service was fabulous and our room was always immaculate. special thanks to spider our pullman and more our valet who went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care of.  spider saved the day with  room delivery of purchases from our car, and when a little staff occurred at the valet stand more made sure everything was smoothed over to our satisfaction by taking those extra steps. two truly exceptional employees."
1949,hyattplacedallasparkcentral,"all the staff were extremely helpful and friendly.    the room was nice and well designed. the only downfall to the room is that the beds and pillows aren’t very comfortable .  there are a couple us plugs in the room, a single cup during type coffee maker and a very small refrigerator (big enough to store a few bottles)  there is a 24 hour coffee shop in the lobby that also carries several snacks and drinks. there are a few restaurant on the and floor that are open at various times.  i didn’t eat at any of them so i can’t comment about the food quality.  i did meet up with some friends at the bar for a drink, it was nice, one friend also ordered a salad that looked very good.  there is a nice fitness center and a pool, although the pool is outside and not covered (something to"

1961,homewoodsuites,"the efficiency studies at this property - though in need of some tic already-  quite possibly have everything you might need for a stay longer than three nights, so i would definitely consider it if i needed to stay for a week (kitchenette fully equipped etc)  they are maintained very clean by a dedicated housekeeping staff.  there are  convenience like sundry facilities  -also in need of some tic-  on site, which also cater to longer  stays and breakfast in included in the rate.  it's ok, nothing to write home about; it is exactly the same stuff served by any other  hampton inn.     this said, as a hilton honors diamond member i was a bit disappointed by some of the staff at front desk, rather dismissive and uninterested. - specifically  this one say young girl with short"

1965,homewoodsuites,this was not my first time there. the proximity to meeting venue is a great advantage. the rate for the first night was super expensive because of the un general assembly. the employees were polite and helpful and the beverage area was completely stacked at all times. the snacks in the room were non extent.

1967,homewoodsuites,"it is a decent & clean hotel with most amenities one needs for a longer stay. however not special or sophisticated (as one might assume given it is a hilton branch). the room is clean and is kept clean thoroughly. detergents for the dishwasher or to clean one's dishes are provided but no sponge or brush (which makes cleaning up single plates/dishes difficult). also, i didn't have a remote control for the to. other than that, all one could need for a longer stay is provided.  the breakfast buffets is average. the quality of food is satisfying, the range covers bread/wages with (mostly) sweet spreads, butter and cream cheese, cereal & milk (with almond milk as dairy free alternative), yoghurt and fresh fruit as well as warm savory dishes and sweet dishes. the warm dishes change"

1990,hoteledison,"first long haul flight so need to express how we was left feeling at check in . saturday evening walked in to a rude lady who didn’t even give eye contact saying just the word ‘passport’ . then rudely said everyone’s passport , i replied you only said for mine to which my friend said she smiled .  not hello how was your flight , no pleasantries at all !!!!  further more of booking bed and breakfast we are rudely explained to the next day by a gentleman that only half the party get breakfast voucher per night . can’t remember seeing on my booking bed and breakfast for half the party 🤣🤣 tired after a long flight and feeling vulnerable in a new country it was awful to be greeted how we was .  hotel is lovely and some lovely luggage and attendance guns but seriously there needs"
1991,hoteledison,"we have just returned from 4 nights at the madison. the hotel was nice, rooms were average. the bedroom and beds are lovely but the bathroom are small and could do with being refurbished. the shower was cold, no hot water and the air con / radiations in the room were loud and kept us awake at night. and the to was a nightmare to work. unable to use the moves and often lost signal. we found the staff rude and any issues that we may of had we didn’t want to raise it with the hotel out of fear of the rude staff. i probably would stay again as in new york you are barely in your room but i would hope the unpleasantness of the staff would improve!"
1992,hoteledison,the location of the hotel madison is ideal. it is steps away from times square and close to theaters and restaurant. the staff is very friendly and accommodation.  there are two in house restaurant that can be accessed from inside the hotel. there is a complimentary wine hour on tuesdays & friday with live music. guests also have access to several free walking hours.  the rooms are very nice and comfortable. i highly recommend this hotel when you are visiting ny.
1993,hoteledison,"my girlfriend and her best friend are staying at the hotel now and absolutely love ❤️   it ( recommended by me )  they have had  first class service from the very start of their stay , they love their room and especially enjoyed  the amenities package provided by the hotel"
1994,hoteledison,"i stay here a few times a year and always have a good stay. no issues on this trip, but in the past if there was a problem (very rare) it was handled immediately. they take security seriously here, which is a comfort. lots of on-site and nearby food option, close to times square, theaters, and subways entrances. i’ll stay here again - literally, i’ll be back in two months!"
1995,hoteledison,"i had an unfortunate situation at hotel madison and i have spent over a year and a half simply trying to get a hold of someone to help me find resolution. i have sent several messages, letters and phone calls yet no one gathered to even acknowledge my concerns. i had really hoped to resolve this situation amicably and professionally but instead they are forcing my hand to write this negative review and as reviews are important to this industry maybe one day they will read this note and might actually look at this opportunity to better their customer service and relations.  simple communication goes a long way. i am a patient and reasonable person but i feel that my business was not at all valued and my concerns ignored.  i travel to ny several times a year and send my clients,"
1996,hoteledison,beds are good rooms are a little small but that is to be expected.great location close to everything. it would be nice to have a small table and chairs in the room. the breakfast we had included was very good at carve sandwiched just down the street.
1997,hoteledison,"i have been a loyal customer for 38 years and can’t wait to return in 2024!!! this year we had a group of 20 and everyone loved it.   the hotel is the very best of new york. it has the absolute best location. only 1/2 block from the red teachers in times square, yet quiet enough to really rest after a busy day. the rooms are so comfortable and the staff is simply amazing!!   i highly recommend this place. it gives you the best feeling and charm of old new york with all the comforts and amenities of modern new york. it is simply great."
1998,hoteledison,"feat begolli was so helpful with our bags and service. he went above and beyond to make our stay pleasant and enjoyable. he was friendly, kind, helpful attentive    we absolutely loved him. i will return to this hotel specifically because of feat."
1999,hoteledison,"i recently stayed at the hotel madison from 11/30/23-12/3/23 and experienced one the most enjoyable stays in all my 20 years of staying at the madison. the staff from the footmen, security, housekeeping staff, and especially the front desk treated me like royalty! one person i would like to recognize is case. she is a phenomena person who truly cares about her guests. she treats everyone like family, and assures all your needs are taken care of. it is her mission to greet all the guests of hotel madison, and treats all like family! there was never a time when i encountered case, when she didn’t greet me by name. i look forward to coming back just to see case. she is an asset to the organization, and should be recognized as a outstanding employee. i look forward to coming"
